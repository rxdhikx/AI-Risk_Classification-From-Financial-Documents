PART I Item 1. BUSINESS General Hurco Companies, Inc. is an international, industrial technology company. We design, manufacture, and sell computerized (i.e., Computer Numeric Control CNC )) machine tools, consisting primarily of vertical machining centers (mills) and turning centers (lathes), to companies in the metal cutting industry through a worldwide sales, service, and distribution network. Although the majority of our computer control systems and software products are proprietary, they predominantly use industry standard personal computer components. Our computer control systems and software products are primarily sold as integral components of our computerized machine tool products. We also provide machine tool components, automation integration equipment and solutions for job shops, software options, control upgrades, accessories and replacement parts for our products, as well as customer service, training, and applications support. As used in this report, the words we , us , our , Hurco and the Company refer to Hurco Companies, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries. Since our founding in 1968, we have been a leader in the introduction of interactive computer control systems that automate manufacturing processes and improve productivity in the metal parts manufacturing industry. We pioneered the application of microprocessor technology and conversational programming software for use in machine tools. Our Hurco brand computer control systems can be operated by both skilled and unskilled machine tool operators and, yet, are capable of instructing a machine to perform complex tasks. The combination of microprocessor technology and patented interactive, conversational programming software in our proprietary computer control systems enables operators on the production floor to create a program quickly and easily to machine a particular part from a blueprint or computer aided design file, and immediately begin machining that part. Our executive offices and principal design and engineering operations are headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S. We have sales, application engineering, and service subsidiaries in China, France, Germany, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. We have manufacturing and assembly operations in Taiwan, the U.S., Italy, and China, and distribution facilities in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Taiwan. Our strategy is to design, manufacture, and sell a comprehensive line of computerized machine tools that help customers in the worldwide metal cutting market increase productivity and profitability. The majority of our machine tools employ proprietary, interactive computer control technology that increases productivity through ease of operation via interactive conversational and graphical programming software. All of our machine tools, regardless of brand, deliver high levels of machine performance (speed, accuracy and surface finish quality) that increase productivity. We routinely expand our product offerings to meet customer needs, which has led us to design and manufacture more complex machining centers with advanced capabilities. We bring a disciplined approach to strategically enter new geographic markets, as appropriate. 
 3 

Our strategic plans focus on market expansion to reach more customers with more products on a global basis. We have made five acquisitions since 2013, and the products we have added through these acquisitions have given us more advanced products with significant improvements in our machine tool accuracy and precision, allow us to seek higher productivity in complex manufacturing environments, provide automation for machine tending solutions, and minimize dependencies associated with volatilities from economic and geographic cyclicality. While the Hurco-branded computer control systems have been, and continue to be, our premium flagship product line, we have added other products to our portfolio that provide product diversity and market penetration opportunity priced from entry-level to high performance serving a variety of different industries. We have not changed our overall strategy to design, manufacture, and sell a comprehensive line of computerized machine tools; rather, we have enhanced this strategy through growth both organically and through acquisitions in an effort to attain long-term stability and profitability. During fiscal year 2022, our sales and service fees were 250.8 million, an increase of 15.6 million, or 7 , compared to fiscal year 2021 and included an unfavorable currency impact of 13.9 million, or 6 , when translating foreign sales to U.S. Dollars for financial reporting purposes. For fiscal year 2022, we reported net income of 8.2 million, or 1.23 per diluted share, compared to net income of 6.8 million, or 1.01 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2021. During fiscal year 2022, sales increased year-over-year due primarily to inflationary price increases and an increased volume of shipments of higher-performance Hurco, Takumi, and Milltronics machines across Europe and North America. Industry Machine tool products are considered capital goods, which makes them part of an industry that has historically been highly cyclical. Industry association data for the U.S. machine tool market is available, and that market accounts for approximately 15 of worldwide consumption. Reports available for the U.S. machine tool market include: The 2021 World Machine Tool Survey by Gardner Intelligence; United States Machine Tool Consumption generated by the Association for Manufacturing Technology, this report includes metal cutting machines of all types and sizes, including segments in which we do not compete; Purchasing Manager s Index developed by the Institute for Supply Management, this report includes activity levels in U.S. manufacturing plants that purchase machine tools; and Capacity Utilization of Manufacturing Companies issued by the Federal Reserve Board. A limited amount of information is available for foreign markets, and different reporting methodologies are used by various countries. Machine tool consumption data, published by the Association for Manufacturing Technology, calculates machine tool consumption annually by country. It is important to note that data for foreign countries are based on government reports that may lag six to 12 months behind real-time and, therefore, are unreliable for forecasting purposes. Demand for capital equipment can fluctuate significantly during periods of changing economic conditions. Manufacturers and suppliers of capital goods, such as our company, are often the first to experience these changes in demand. Additionally, since build to stock and our typical order backlog is approximately 45 days, it is difficult to estimate demand with any reasonable certainty. Therefore, we do not have the benefit of relying on the common leading indicators that other industries use for market analysis and forecasting purposes.

Hurco CNC Machine Tools Hurco computerized machine tools are equipped with a fully integrated interactive computer control system that features our proprietary WinMax software. Our computer control system enables a machine tool operator to create complex two-dimensional 2D or three-dimensional 3D machining programs directly from an engineering drawing or computer-aided design geometry file, such as a solid model. An operator with little or no machine tool programming experience can successfully create a program with minimal training and begin machining the part in a short period of time. The control features an operator console with a touch-screen and incorporates an upgradeable personal computer PC platform using a high-speed processor with solid rendering graphical programming. In addition, WinMax has a Windows based operating system that enables users to improve shop floor flexibility and software productivity. Companies using computer-controlled machine tools are better able to: maximize the efficiency of their human resources; make more advanced and complex parts from a wide range of materials using multiple processes; incorporate fast moving changes in technology into their operations to keep their competitive edge; and integrate their business into the global supply chain of their customers by supporting small to medium lot sizes for just in time initiatives. Our Windows based Hurco control facilitates our ability to meet these customer needs. The familiar Windows operating system coupled with our intuitive conversational style of program creation allows our customers operators to create and edit part-making programs without incurring the incremental overhead of specialized computer aided design CAD and computer aided manufacturing CAM programmers. With the ability to transfer most CAD data directly into a Hurco program, part programming time can be significantly reduced. Machine tool products must be designed to meet customer demand to machine complex parts with greater part accuracies. Our proprietary controls with WinMax software and high-speed processors efficiently handle the large amounts of data these complex part-making programs require and enable our customers to create parts with higher accuracy at faster speeds. We continue to add technology to our control design as it becomes available. UltiMotion , our patented motion control system, provides significant cycle time reductions and increases the quality of a part s surface finish. This technology differentiates us in the marketplace and is incorporated into our control. Our offering of Hurco machining centers, currently equipped with either a dual touch-screen console or a single touch-screen console, consists of the following product lines: VMi Product Line The VM product line consists of moderately priced vertical machining centers for the entry-level market, while still offering the advantage of our advanced control and motion systems.

Other Computer Control Systems and Software Products The following machine tool computer control systems and software products are sold directly to end-users and/or to other original equipment manufacturers OEMs ). Autobend Our Autobend computer control systems are applied to metal bending press brake machines that form parts from sheet metal and steel plate. They consist of a microprocessor-based computer control and back gauge (an automated gauging system that determines where the bend will be made). We have manufactured and sold the Autobend product line since 1968. We currently market two models of our Autobend computer control systems for press brake machines, in combination with six different back gauges as retrofit units for installation on existing or new press brake machines. Software Products In addition to our standard computer control features, we offer software option products for part programming. These products are sold to users of our Hurco computerized machine tools equipped with our dual touch-screen or single touch-screen consoles featuring WinMax control software. Each international division packages the options as appropriate for its market. The most common options include Advanced Verification Graphics, Solid Model Import with 3D DXF Technology, Swept Surface, DXF Transfer, UltiMonitor, UltiPocket with Helical Ramp Entry and Insert Pockets, Conversational Part and Tool Probing, Tool and Material Library, NC/Conversational Merge, Job List, Automation Job Manager, Stream Load, Active Thermal Compensation, Thread Repair, and Simultaneous Five-Axis Contouring. The Advanced Verification Graphics option displays a picture of the rendered part on the screen of the control that can be viewed from any angle. The detail allows the customer to evaluate how the part is programmed to be machined before cutting commences, which eliminates the need to scrap expensive material. Our Swept Surface software option simplifies programming of 3D contours and significantly reduces programming time. The DXF Transfer software option increases operator productivity because it eliminates manual data entry of part features by transferring AutoCAD drawing files directly into our computer control or into our desktop programming software, WinMax Desktop. Solid Model Import with 3D DXF Technology automatically uses geometry from a 3D CAD model to easily create conversational programs for 2D and 3D parts or even 3+2 and 5-sided parts. Designed to take advantage of the Internet of Things, UltiMonitor is a web-based productivity, management, and service tool that enables customers to monitor, inspect, and receive notifications about their Hurco machines from any location where they can access the internet. Customers can transfer part designs, receive event notifications via email for text, access diagnostic data, monitor the machine via webcam, and communicate with the machine operator. UltiPocket with Helical Ramp Entry and Insert Pockets automatically calculates the tool path around islands, eliminating the arduous task of plotting these shapes. Islands can also be rotated, scaled and repeated. ________________________ AutoCAD is a registered trademark of Autodesk, Inc., and/or its subsidiaries/ affiliates in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Conversational Part and Tool Probing options permit the computerized dimensional measurement of machined parts and the associated cutting tools. This on-machine technique improves the throughput of the measurement process when compared to traditional off-machine approaches. The Tool and Material Library option stores the tool and material information with the machine instead of storing it with each individual part program. The user enters the tool data and geometry one time and chooses the particular tool from the list when it is needed. Additionally, the library reads the part program and automatically locates the tool or displays an alert if the tool does not exist. In addition to saving time, the Tool and Material Library eliminates the need to enter information repeatedly and can prevent common tool crash conditions. NC/Conversational Merge lets the user incorporate conversational features, such as tool probing, pattern operations, and scaling, into existing G-Code programs. Job List provides an intuitive way to group files together and run them sequentially without operator intervention, which promotes automation, lights-out machining, program stitching, file bundling, and adaptive processes. Automation Job Manager is a software feature designed specifically for seamless integration of the Hurco control to our automation package called Job Shop Automation, which promotes intuitive programming of collaborative robots for machine tending applications. Stream Load allows the user to run very large NC files without the need to upload the entire file into the control s memory to avoid exceeding memory limits. Active Thermal Compensation is a feature that uses sensors to measure head casting temperature growth and software that automatically compensates for that growth, improving part accuracy. Thread Repair is a feature for turning applications that provides an efficient way to repair existing threads, which is especially beneficial for large pipes and other parts manufactured for the oil/energy sector. Simultaneous Five-Axis Contouring software enables a five-axis machine to command motion concurrently on all axes. This allows the user to create continuous tool-paths along complex geometries with only a single machine/part setup, providing increased productivity along with the performance benefits of using shorter cutting tools. The sale of simultaneous five-axis contouring software is subject to government export licensing requirements. ProCobots CNC Automation ProCobots provides automation solutions including collaborative robots (cobots), grippers, material handling, and Industry 4.0-capable software and controls. Designed to be easy to use, safe, and flexible, ProCobots solutions are standardized systems aimed at customers who are in the high-mix, low- and medium-volume manufacturing environments. Products include portable models, such as the ProFeeder Flex and ProFeeder Table, as well as flexible cell solutions, including the ProFeeder and Easy Desk, and higher volume systems including the ProFeeder Compact, ProFeeder X, and ProFeeder XL models.

Manufacturing Our computerized metal cutting machine tools are manufactured and assembled to our specifications primarily by our wholly-owned subsidiary in Taiwan (Hurco Manufacturing Limited HML )). HML conducts final assembly operations and is supported by a network of contract suppliers of components and sub-assemblies that manufacture components for our products. Our facility in Ningbo, China (Ningbo Hurco Machine Tool Co. Ltd NHML )) focuses on the machining of castings to support HML s production in Taiwan. The LCM line of electro-mechanical components and accessories for machine tools is designed and manufactured in Italy. Our facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, also conducts final assembly operations for certain Hurco VMX machines, Milltronics IL/XP models, and Milltronics bridge mills for the American market and manufactures certain electro-spindle components for LCM. We have a contract manufacturing agreement for computer control systems with Hurco Automation, Ltd. HAL ), a Taiwanese company in which we have a 35 ownership interest. This company produces all of our computer control systems to our specifications, sources industry standard computer components and our proprietary parts, performs final assembly, and conducts test operations. We work closely with our subsidiaries, key component suppliers, and HAL to ensure that their production capacity will be sufficient to meet the projected demand for our machine tool products. Many of the key components used in our machines can be sourced from multiple suppliers. However, any prolonged interruption of operations or significant reduction in the capacity or performance capability at any of our manufacturing facilities, or at any of our key component suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Marketing and Distribution We principally sell our products through approximately 200 independent agents and distributors throughout North and South America (the Americas ), Europe, and Asia. Although some distributors carry competitive products, we are the primary line for the majority of our distributors globally. We also have our own direct sales and service organizations in China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and certain parts of the United States , which are among the world s principal machine tool consuming markets. Our selling divisions in the United States have responsibility for the Americas, which includes Canada, Mexico, Central America, South America, and the U.S. Approximately 85 of the worldwide demand for computerized machine tools and computer control systems is outside of the U.S. In fiscal year 2022, approximately 62 of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the Americas. No single end-user or distributor of our products accounted for more than 5 of our total sales and service fees. The end-users of our products are precision tool, die and mold manufacturers, independent job shops, specialized short-run production applications within large manufacturing operations, and manufacturing facilities that focus on medium-to-high run production of large batches of a few types of parts instead of small batches of many different parts. Industries served include aerospace, defense, medical equipment, energy, automotive/transportation, electronics, and computer industries. We also sell our Autobend computer control systems to OEMs of new metal fabrication machine tools that integrate them with their own products prior to the sale of those products to their own customers, to retrofitters of used metal fabrication machine tools that integrate them with those machines as part of the retrofitting operation, and to end-users that have an installed base of metal fabrication machine tools, either with or without related computer control systems.

Human Capital Resources Hurco is committed to attracting and retaining the brightest and best talent. Therefore, investing, developing, and maintaining human capital is critical to our success. As of October 31, 2022, Hurco had approximately 735 full-time employees, of which approximately 27 were in the Americas and 73 were in other global regions. As a global industrial technology company, a large number of our employees are engineers or trained trade or technical workers focusing on advanced manufacturing, and many of them hold masters , doctorate, or equivalent advanced degrees. Hurco emphasizes a number of measures and objectives in managing its human capital assets, including, among others, employee safety and wellness, talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement, development, and training, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. None of our employees are covered by a collective-bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any employee-generated work stoppages or disruptions, and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. COVID-19 and Employee Safety and Wellness During the COVID-19 pandemic, the safety and well-being of our employees and their families has been a top priority as we continue to serve our customers many of which are involved in the installation, production, and/or maintenance of critical infrastructure. Our global pandemic efforts include leveraging the advice and recommendations of infectious disease experts and organizations to establish appropriate safety standards and secure appropriate levels of personal protective equipment for our workforce. Based upon this advice and recommendations, we have adopted and implemented the Hurco COVID-19 Exposure Prevention, Preparedness, and Response Plan (the Hurco COVID Response Plan to outline our policies and procedures designed to mitigate the potential for transmission of COVID-19 and prevent exposure to illness from certain other infectious diseases. Among other things, the Hurco COVID Response Plan memorializes employee, manager, and company responsibilities related to house-keeping and sanitization, hygiene and respiratory etiquette, use of personal protective equipment, employee, and visitor screening procedures, leave policies and accommodations, remote working opportunities and infrastructure, and protocols for not reporting to work and/or when to return to work upon potential and/or confirmed COVID-19 exposure or infection. In addition to procuring personal protective equipment, automatic screening stations, and other preventative resources, we have also leveraged Hurco technology and human capital to directly produce personal protective equipment on Hurco products and distributed the same to our personnel and customers around the world. We have also implemented a wellness program aimed at engaging employees with healthcare providers to promote the proactive evaluation, tracking, and management of major health and wellness indicators, such as blood pressure, weight, and routine blood laboratory analysis. Employee Engagement, Development, and Training We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. We advance continual learning and career development through ongoing performance and development conversations or evaluations with employees, internally and externally developed training programs, and educational reimbursement programs. In connection with the latter, reimbursement is available to employees enrolled in pre-approved degree or certification programs at accredited institutions that teach skills or knowledge relative to our business or otherwise to the development of the employee s skill set or knowledge base. In addition, we routinely invest in seminar, conference, and other training or continuing education events for our employees. 
 17

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS In this section, we describe what we believe to be the material risks related to our business. The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report are not the only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known and/or risks we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the developments included in the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Industry and International Operations The cyclical nature of our business causes fluctuations in our operating results. The machine tool industry is highly cyclical and changes in demand can occur abruptly in the geographic markets we serve. As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced significant fluctuations in our sales, which, in periods of reduced demand, have adversely affected our results of operations and financial condition, which could re-occur in the future. Uncertain global economic conditions have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, overall demand. We typically sell the majority of our larger, high-performance VMX machines in Europe, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic and market conditions in that region. Economic uncertainty and business downturns in the U.S., European, and Asian Pacific markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, global economic uncertainty and business downturns may be exacerbated or exaggerated in markets that are subject to ongoing wars or conflicts or in markets that depend on resources, energy, or supply chains from jurisdictions participating in such wars or conflicts. In particular, many markets in Europe and throughout the world are currently being negatively impacted by the war in Ukraine and resulting sanctions imposed on Russia. Our international operations pose additional risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings. During fiscal year 2022, approximately 62 of our revenues were derived from sales to customers located outside of the Americas . In addition, our main manufacturing facilities are located outside of the U.S. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including: trade barriers; regional economic uncertainty and nationalistic trade strategies; differing labor regulation; governmental expropriation; domestic and foreign customs and tariffs; current and changing regulatory environments affecting the importation and exportation of products and raw materials; difficulty in obtaining distribution support; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; differences in the availability and terms of financing; political instability and unrest; negative or unforeseen consequences resulting from the introduction, termination, modification, or renegotiation of international trade agreements or treaties or the imposition of countervailing measures or anti-dumping duties or similar tariffs; 
 19 

foreign exchange controls that make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash; changes in tax regulations and rates in foreign countries; and changes in the geopolitical environment, wars, conflicts, or trade barriers or blockades in the European Union and Asia, which may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, as well as disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between countries. Quotas, tariffs, taxes, or other trade barriers could require us to attempt to change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development, withdraw from or not enter certain markets, or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us and/or that we might not be able to accomplish in a timely manner or at all. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. These factors may adversely affect our future operating results. The vast majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung to four ports of destination: Los Angeles, California; Tacoma, Washington; Venlo, the Netherlands; and Shanghai, China. Changes in customs requirements, as a result of national security or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Similarly, significant delays at one or more of the ports where our products are shipped or received has impacted, and could continue to impact, the amount of time required to ship our products to customers, which could materially adversely impact our business, demand for our products, our ability to meet quoted delivery dates, our results of operations, future operations, and/or financial condition. Additionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, tariffs or duties, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially adversely affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies, procedures, and training designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. Finally, a significant portion of our manufacturing, production, and assembly operations are located in certain limited geographic territories, including the People s Republic of China China and the Republic of China Taiwan ). An unplanned interruption in manufacturing or supply, or significant increase in price from third party suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such an interruption or increase in price could result from various factors, including a change in the political environment, such as trade wars or tariffs, a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami, or vulnerabilities in our technology or cyber-attacks against our information systems, such as ransomware attacks. Also, any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 20 

Additionally, the geopolitical environment and ongoing sovereign relationship between China and Taiwan, including recent heightened tensions between them, could have a material impact on our business. Specifically, if a trade war, tariff, physical or economic blockade, or war ensued and impacted access to or from the Taiwan or Chinese markets or workforce, we could have challenges maintaining production plans or output, accessing the skilled labor necessary to produce our products without interruption, accessing and/or shipping our finished goods, work in progress, or other inventories located in either of those territories, accessing or maintaining our supply base that is located in those territories or elsewhere, and/or otherwise experience significant disruptions in our business. Such disruptions, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In such a case, we may be forced to relocate and/or shift production facilities to other geographic territories to mitigate the risks associated with consolidating our manufacturing operations in such territories, which would likely result in disruptions to our production plans and/or our ability to meet forecasted customer demand in the near and medium term, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results, future operations, and/or financial position. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and any of several foreign currencies can increase our costs and decrease our revenues. Our sales to customers located outside of the Americas, which generated approximately 62 of our revenues in fiscal year 2022, are invoiced and received in several foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan. Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar, both for purposes of actual conversion and for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we are exposed to exchange risk associated with our purchases of materials and components for our Taiwan manufacturing operations, which are primarily made in the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro. We hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedge contracts only mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counterparty failure. There can be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects. We compete with larger companies that have greater financial resources, and our business could be harmed by competitors actions. The markets in which our products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete with other manufacturers in terms of quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, many of which are larger and have substantially greater financial resources and some of which have been supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies and, therefore, may have competitive advantages over us. Our financial resources are limited compared to those of many of our competitors, making it challenging to remain competitive. The United Kingdom s withdrawal from the European Union could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom U.K. withdrew from the European Union E.U. ), commonly referred to as Brexit. On or around that time, the U.K. and E.U. agreed to participate in a transition period (the Transition Period ), which expired on December 31, 2020, to negotiate a trade agreement and other aspects of their relationship after the Transition Period. During the Transition Period, free trade continued between the U.K. and E.U. without checks or extra charges. Following the Transition Period, the U.K. is no longer a part of the single market and customs union of the E.U. However, immediately prior to expiration of the Transition Period, the U.K. and E.U. announced they had entered into a post-Brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues (the December 2020 Brexit Deal avoiding some of the anticipated disruption of a no-deal, hard Brexit. 
 21 

We have operations in the U.K. related to Hurco Europe Ltd. HEL ), our sales and service business unit located there. Changes resulting from Brexit, the December 2020 Brexit Deal, and/or subsequent transition agreements or arrangements could subject us or our subsidiaries, including HEL, to increased risk, including, among others, changes in regulatory oversight, disruptions to supply, increases in prices, fees, taxes or tariffs on goods that are sold between the E.U. and the U.K., inspections or barriers on goods sold between the U.K. and the E.U., extra charges, and/or difficulty staffing. We have evaluated the impact of Brexit on us, our subsidiaries, including HEL, our business, and our future operations, operating results, and cash flows, and it has not materially changed our business to date. In addition, we do not know if the U.K. and E.U. will succeed in negotiating all material terms not otherwise addressed or covered by the December 2020 Brexit Deal or subsequent transition agreements or arrangements and/or if previously agreed upon items will be renegotiated in the future. Changes in these or other terms resulting from Brexit could, similarly, subject us or our subsidiaries, including HEL, to increased risk, including, among others, changes in regulatory oversight, disruptions to supply, increases in prices, fees, taxes or tariffs on goods that are sold between the E.U. and the U.K., inspections or barriers on goods sold between the U.K. and the E.U., extra charges, and/or difficulty staffing. Brexit may also cause fluctuations in the value of the Pound Sterling and the Euro. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our expenses, earnings, cash flows, results of operations, and revenues. Although we attempt to mitigate our exposure to some of our foreign currency exchange risks through hedging arrangements, our hedging arrangements may not target the potential impacts associated with fluctuations in currency resulting from Brexit or otherwise effectively offset the adverse financial impacts. Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic Public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases have disrupted, and could continue to disrupt, our operations and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Widespread public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related resurgences, governmental authorities in jurisdictions where our facilities, customers, and suppliers are located have imposed mandatory closures, stay-at-home orders, and social distancing protocols that significantly limit the movement of people, goods, and services or otherwise restrict normal business operations or consumption patterns. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and will likely continue to affect our business. Specifically, many of our sales and service organizations throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific have, at one time or another, been subject to temporary closures or otherwise been required to adopt remote work strategies. We may continue to experience additional temporary facility closures in response to government mandates and/or the incidence of additional spread.

Additionally, the COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted and could in the future disrupt our ability to deliver and/or install machines, our procurement of supplies for our operations, and our customers purchasing behavior or decisions. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significantly reduced demand for our products in certain markets from time to time, which could continue for an extended period of time. Any or all of the foregoing in jurisdictions where we or our customers, suppliers, or business partners are located have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, fluctuations in demand and other implications associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in, and could continue resulting in, certain supply chain constraints and challenges. Significant increases in economic and demand uncertainty have led to disruption and volatility in the global credit and financial markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital for both our company and our customers and suppliers. In addition, resulting changes in our access to or cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors could cause our intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down the intangible assets for the amount of the impairment. The duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and related effects remain uncertain and, therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, but such impact has been, and could continue to be, material. Operational and Strategic Risks Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market. The machine tool industry is subject to technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customers requirements, and competitors product offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, are significant factors in maintaining and improving our competitive position and growth prospects, and we may not be able to accomplish those actions on a timely basis or at all. If the technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected. Developments by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Our continued success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements, other contractual arrangements, trade secret law, trademark registration, and patents to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary information and enforce our intellectual property rights through infringement proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are also subject to claims that we may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, reduce the market value of our products and services, lower our profits, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 23 

Finally, certain subcontractors, vendors, and third parties provide inputs, components, code, and/or similar items that are complimentary and compatible with our products, software, and controls. If we are unable to secure access and/or rights to any such inputs, components, code, or similar items, our ability to continue to produce our products without interruption could be challenged, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operation, and demand for our products. Disruptions in our manufacturing operations or the supply of materials and components could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We depend on our wholly owned subsidiaries, HML, NHML, Milltronics, and LCM, to produce our machine tools and electro-mechanical components and accessories in Taiwan, China, the U.S., and Italy, respectively. We also depend on our 35 owned affiliate, HAL, and other key third-party suppliers to produce our computer control systems and key components, such as motors and drives, for our machine tools. An unplanned interruption in manufacturing or supply, or a significant increase in price from third party suppliers, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such an interruption or increase in price could result from various factors, including a change in the political environment, such as trade wars or tariffs, a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami, or vulnerabilities in our technology or cyber-attacks against our information systems, such as ransomware attacks. Also, any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the price of raw materials and other inputs, especially steel, iron, and energy, could adversely affect our sales, costs, and profitability. We manufacture products with a high iron and steel content. The availability and price for these and other raw materials, as well as for other inputs such as energy, are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, anticipated or perceived shortages, geopolitical relationships or conflicts, and tariffs or other trade restrictions. In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases, in other cases, they cannot. If the prices of raw materials and other inputs increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, our results of operations would be adversely affected. Recent inflationary pressures and other factors have resulted in increases to the cost of the inputs or raw materials for our products. Similarly, recently, costs associated with transportation and freight services have previously increased significantly due to limited capacity and/or availability of containers, shipping vessels, and/or receiving port services. If prolonged, and if they cannot be passed on to customers in the form of price increases, these fluctuations in the price of raw materials, product components, other inputs, and/or transportation services could adversely affect our sales, costs, margin, and profitability. The unanticipated loss of current members of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results. The unexpected loss of members of our senior management team or other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The loss of senior management or other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departed personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions. Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. We actively seek additional opportunities to expand our product offerings or the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: 
 24 

difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company or being subjected to liability for the target s pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest; diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business; potential difficulties completing projects associated with in-process research and development; difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; and the potential for recording goodwill and intangible assets that later can be subject to impairment. Acquisitions may also cause us to: issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership; borrow and subject us to increasing interest rates; assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company; record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges; incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses; and become subject to litigation. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we recorded a one-time 4.9 million non-cash impairment charge on goodwill arising from prior acquisitions. The goodwill impairment charge was attributable primarily to the prolonged ongoing uncertainty in the global markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that an acquisition will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate an acquisition could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that enhancements to those products will be made in a timely manner or that pre-acquisition due diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products or the acquired business. Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions. For additional information, please see the risk factor entitled, Due to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive. 
 25 

Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results and business. A number of U.S. states have enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, financial information, and other personal information. For example, several U.S. territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individual victims, and at times regulators, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive personal data. Other state laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA ), which gives California residents certain privacy rights in the collection and disclosure of their personal information and requires businesses to make certain disclosures and take certain other acts in furtherance of those rights. Additionally, effective starting January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (the CPRA revised and significantly expanded the scope of the CCPA. The CPRA also created a new California data protection agency authorized to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA, which could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. Other states have considered and/or enacted similar privacy laws. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation, and carry significant potential liability for our business. Outside of the U.S., data protection laws, including the U.K. and E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR ), also apply to some of our operations. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. The GDPR imposes, among other things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, and transfer U.K. or EU personal data, as applicable, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4 of total worldwide annual revenue under the E.U. GDPR and up to the greater of 17.5 million Pounds or 4 of annual global turnover under the U.K. GDPR). Other governmental authorities around the world are considering and, in some cases, have enacted, similar privacy and data security laws. The interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, and could negatively affect our operating results and business. 
 26 

If our network and system security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our data, to our employees , customers , or vendors data, or to our critical information technology systems, we may incur legal and financial exposure and liabilities. As part of our business, we store our data and certain data about our employees, customers, and vendors in our information technology systems. If a third party gained unauthorized access to our data, including any data regarding our employees, customers, or vendors, the security breach could expose us to risks, including loss of business, litigation, and possible liability. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or other information to gain access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. In addition, given their size and complexity, our information systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors, and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems, or confidential information. Like other public, multi-national corporations, we have and will continue to be subject to, instances of phishing attacks on our email systems, other cyber-attacks, including state-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, and other malware, wire fraud, or other cyber incidents. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, are becoming more sophisticated, frequent, and adaptive, and therefore, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in: the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information; the unauthorized release of employee, customer, or vendor data and payment information; a loss of confidence by our customers; damage to our reputation; a disruption to our business; litigation and legal liability; and a negative impact on our future sales. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection or data restoration measures could be significant. Financial, Credit, and Liquidity Risks Due to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive. The technology within our products evolves, and we periodically bring new versions of our machines to market. The phasing out of an old product involves estimating the amount of inventory required to satisfy the final demand for those machines and to satisfy future repair part needs. Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because of unforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, we might have to write off unusable inventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations. 
 27 

Assets have become, and may become further, impaired, requiring us to record a significant charge to earnings. We review our assets, including intangible assets, for indications of impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements for the period in which any impairment of these assets is determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations for that period. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we recorded a one-time 4.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge arising from prior acquisitions, and we may be required to record impairment charges on other assets in the future. We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences. We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. We review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax-planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in our profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We also earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates. We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions, including the U.S., may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including tax laws in the U.S. Similarly, changes in tax laws or regulations, including those in the U.S., could negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in a statutory tax rate may result in the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the relevant jurisdiction in which the new tax law is enacted, potentially resulting in a material expense or benefit recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income for that period. In December 2017, the U.S. passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company has evaluated and recorded the aggregate impact of this passed legislation on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. Any benefits associated with lower U.S. corporate tax rates could be reduced or outweighed by other tax changes adverse to our business or operations, such as new or additional taxes imposed on earnings and/or reinvested earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The aggregate impact of such legislation, including adverse future regulatory guidance, could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations. Other changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. For example, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD ). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These changes, as adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.

 29 

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we are involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. Pursuant to applicable accounting rules, we accrue the minimum liability for each known claim when the estimated outcome is a range of possible loss and no one amount within that range is more likely than another. We maintain insurance policies for such matters, and we record insurance recoveries when we determine such recovery to be probable. We do not expect any of these claims, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We believe that the ultimate resolution of claims for any losses will not exceed our insurance policy coverages. Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES None.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Hurco Companies, Inc. is an international, industrial technology company operating in a single segment. We design, manufacture, and sell computerized (i.e., CNC) machine tools, consisting primarily of vertical machining centers (mills) and turning centers (lathes), to companies in the metal cutting industry through a worldwide sales, service, and distribution network. Although the majority of our computer control systems and software products are proprietary, they predominantly use industry standard personal computer components. Our computer control systems and software products are primarily sold as integral components of our computerized machine tool products. We also provide machine tool components, automation integration equipment and solutions for job shops, software options, control upgrades, accessories and replacement parts for our products, as well as customer service, training, and applications support. The following overview is intended to provide a brief explanation of the principal factors that have contributed to our recent financial performance. This overview is intended to be read in conjunction with the more detailed information included in our financial statements, and notes thereto, that appear elsewhere in this report. 
 32 

The market for machine tools is international in scope. We have both significant foreign sales and significant foreign manufacturing operations. During fiscal year 2022, approximately 50 of our revenues were attributable to customers in Europe, where we typically sell more of our higher-performance, higher-priced VMX series machines. Additionally, approximately 12 of our revenues were attributable to customers in the Asia Pacific region, where we encounter greater pricing pressures. We have three brands of CNC machine tools in our product portfolio. Hurco is the technology innovation brand for customers who want to increase productivity and profitability by selecting a brand with the latest software and motion technology. Milltronics is the value-based brand for shops that want easy-to-use machines at competitive prices. The Takumi brand is for customers that need very high speed, high efficiency performance, such as that required in the production, die and mold, aerospace, and medical industries. Takumi machines are equipped with industry standard controls instead of the proprietary controls found on Hurco and Milltronics machines. These three brands of CNC machine tools are responsible for the vast majority of our revenue. However, we have added other non-Hurco branded products to our product portfolio that have contributed product diversity and market penetration opportunity. These non-Hurco branded products are sold by our wholly-owned distributors and are comprised primarily of other general-purpose vertical milling centers and lathes, laser cutting machines, waterjet cutting machines, CNC grinders, compact horizontal machines, metal cutting saws, and CNC swill lathes. ProCobots is our wholly-owned subsidiary that provides automation solutions. In addition, through our wholly-owned subsidiary LCM, we produce high value machine tool components and accessories. We principally sell our products through approximately 200 independent agents and distributors throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Although some distributors carry competitive products, we are the primary line for the majority of our distributors globally. We also have our own direct sales and service organizations in China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and certain parts of the United States , which are among the world s principal machine tool consuming markets. The vast majority of our machine tools are manufactured to our specifications primarily by our wholly-owned subsidiary in Taiwan, HML. Machine castings to support HML s production are manufactured at our wholly-owned subsidiary in Ningbo, China, NHML. Components to support our SRT line of five-axis machining centers, such as the direct-drive spindle, swivel head, and rotary table, are manufactured by our wholly-owned subsidiary in Italy, LCM. Our sales to foreign customers are denominated, and payments by those customers are made, in the prevailing currencies in the countries in which those customers are located (primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling, and Chinese Yuan). Our product costs are incurred and paid primarily in the New Taiwan Dollar and the U.S. Dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates may have a material effect on our operating results and consolidated financial statements as reported under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. For example, when the U.S. Dollar weakens in value relative to a foreign currency, sales made, and expenses incurred, in that currency when translated to U.S. Dollars for reporting in our financial statements, are higher than would be the case when the U.S. Dollar is stronger. In the comparison of our period-to-period results, we discuss the effect of currency translation on those results, which reflect translation to U.S. Dollars at exchange rates prevailing during the period covered by those financial statements. Our high levels of foreign manufacturing and sales also expose us to cash flow risks due to fluctuating currency exchange rates. We seek to mitigate those risks through the use of derivative instruments principally foreign currency forward exchange contracts. 
 33 

We operate in the industrial equipment industry and have a global footprint that subjects us to various business risks in many different countries. As a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in early 2020, governmental authorities in many of the major global machine tool markets implemented mandatory stay-at-home or shelter orders requiring most businesses to close or to significantly limit operations, resulting in a sudden decrease in demand for many goods and services. Although the mandatory stay-at-home or shelter orders in many jurisdictions permitted our local operations to continue as an essential business or a supplier to critical infrastructure industries or otherwise with remote work capabilities, many of our customers experienced, and continue to experience, significant disruptions in their business operations and normal purchasing cycles. We cannot predict the duration or scope of impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated, but we believe the impact has been material thus far with regard to revenues, income from operations, and cash flow from operations and could continue to be material in the near future. To date, we have experienced some delays in our supply chain and have not completely ceased operations at any of our global facilities, but have implemented remote working capabilities, as appropriate or otherwise required under local law. We have also implemented adjustments in headcount and discretionary spending, delayed capital expenditures, and monitored production activities closely in an effort to weather the adverse business climate. We also received stimulus in various countries to support operations and implemented tax deferrals and provisions that were available to us. We also experienced inflationary pressures and input cost increases in our supply chains on components for our products. We have also seen capacity for transportation and freight services limited significantly by container or vessel availability and delays at departing and receiving ports, all of which have contributed to significantly increased costs and prices associated with the global shipment of our products. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have as significant an impact on our business and industry during fiscal year 2022 as it did in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. However, intermittent lockdowns and similar restrictions in certain markets from time to time continue to impact our business, including those in China pursuant to its zero- tolerance COVID policy. We will continue to evaluate and disclose any trends and uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for and at the end of each interim period. Results of Operations The following table presents, for the fiscal years indicated, selected items from the Consolidated Statements of Operations expressed as a percentage of our worldwide sales and service fees and the year-to-year percentage changes in the dollar amounts of those items. 

34

Sales and service fees for fiscal year 2022 were 250.8 million, an increase of 15.6 million, or 7 , compared to fiscal year 2021, and included an unfavorable currency impact of 13.9 million, or 6 , when translating foreign sales to U.S. Dollars for financial reporting purposes. Net Sales and Service Fees by Geographic Region The following table sets forth net sales and service fees by geographic region for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): 

Fiscal Year Ended October 31, Increase/Decrease 2022 2021 Amount Americas 95,964 38 86,301 37 9,663 11 Europe 126,050 50 117,522 50 8,528 7 Asia Pacific 28,800 12 31,372 13 (2,572) (8) Total 250,814 100 235,195 100 15,619 7 Sales in the Americas for fiscal year 2022 increased by 11 , compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to inflationary price increases and an increased volume of shipments of VM and higher-performance five-axis Hurco machines. European sales for fiscal year 2022 increased by 7 , compared to fiscal year 2021, and included an unfavorable currency impact of 11 , when translating foreign sales to U.S. Dollars for financial reporting purposes. This increase was primarily driven by inflationary price increases, an increased volume of shipments of higher-performance Hurco, Takumi, and Milltronics machines across the European region, as well as increased sales of electro-mechanical components and accessories manufactured by LCM. Asian Pacific sales for fiscal year 2022 decreased by 8 , compared to fiscal year 2021, and included an unfavorable currency impact of 3 , when translating foreign sales to U.S. Dollars for financial reporting purposes. The year-over-year decrease in Asian Pacific sales primarily resulted from a reduced volume of shipments of Hurco and Takumi machines in China and Southeast Asia, partially offset by an increased volume of shipments of Hurco machines in India. The reduced volume of shipments of Hurco and Takumi machines in China was primarily due to recent COVID-19 lockdowns and similar restrictions in major Chinese markets pursuant to China s zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy.

Net Sales and Service Fees by Product Category The following table sets forth net sales and service fees by product group and services for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): 

Fiscal Year Ended October 31, Increase/Decrease 2022 2021 Amount Computerized Machine Tools 211,804 85 198,602 85 13,202 7 Computer Control Systems and Software 2,634 1 2,528 1 106 4 Service Parts 28,219 11 26,425 11 1,794 7 Service Fees 8,157 3 7,640 3 517 7 Total 250,814 100 235,195 100 15,619 7 Amounts shown do not include computer control systems and software sold as an integrated component of computerized machine systems. Sales of computerized machine tools and computer control systems and software for fiscal year 2022 increased by 7 and 4 , respectively, compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to inflationary price increases and an increased volume of shipments of VM and higher-performance five-axis Hurco machines in North America and Europe. Sales of service parts for fiscal year 2022 increased by 7 , compared to fiscal year 2021, due mainly to inflationary price increases and an increased volume of aftermarket sales in North America and the United Kingdom. Service fees increased by 7 during fiscal year 2022, compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to increased aftermarket service for Hurco and Takumi machines throughout Europe. During fiscal year 2022, sales for all product categories included an unfavorable currency impact of 6 , when translating foreign sales to U.S. Dollars for financial reporting purposes. Orders and Backlog . Orders for fiscal year 2022 were 240.9 million, a decrease of 24.5 million, or 9 , compared to fiscal year 2021, and included an unfavorable currency impact of 14.3 million, or 5 , when translating foreign orders to U.S. Dollars. The following table sets forth new orders booked by geographic region for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): 

Fiscal Year Ended October 31, Increase/Decrease 2022 2021 Amount Americas 92,268 38 95,767 36 (3,499) (4) Europe 122,556 51 133,802 50 (11,246) (8) Asia Pacific 26,107 11 35,852 14 (9,745) (27) Total 240,931 100 265,421 100 (24,490) (9) Orders in the Americas for fiscal year 2022 decreased by 4 , compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to decreased customer demand for Hurco and Milltronics machines, partially offset by inflationary price increases implemented during fiscal year 2022. Despite the year-over-year decrease in total machine order volume, machine orders for Hurco lathes and higher-performance five-axis machines increased during the fiscal year. 
 36 

European orders for fiscal year 2022 decreased by 8 , compared to fiscal year 2021, and included an unfavorable currency impact of 10 , when translating foreign orders to U.S. Dollars. This decrease was primarily attributable to the negative impact of currency and decreased customer demand for electro-mechanical components manufactured by LCM and for Hurco machines in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, partially offset by inflationary price increases implemented during fiscal year 2022 and increased demand for Hurco and Takumi machines in Germany and for Milltronics machines across the region. Asian Pacific orders for fiscal year 2022 decreased by 27 , compared to fiscal year 2021, and included an unfavorable currency impact of 4 , when translating foreign orders to U.S. Dollars. The decrease in Asian Pacific orders year-over-year was driven primarily by decreased customer demand for Hurco and Takumi machines in China and Southeast Asia due to recent COVID-19 lockdowns and similar restrictions, partially offset by increased demand for Hurco machines in India. Backlog at October 31, 2022 decreased to 44.8 million from 60.0 million at October 31, 2021, primarily due to decreased customer demand during fiscal year 2022 for all product brands and in all regions where our customers are located. We do not believe backlog is a useful measure of past performance or indicative of future performance. Backlog orders as of October 31, 2022 are expected to be fulfilled in fiscal year 2023. Gross Profit. Gross profit for fiscal year 2022 was 64.5 million, or 26 of sales, compared to 56.2 million, or 24 of sales, for fiscal year 2021. During fiscal year 2021, we recorded approximately 1.2 million, or 1 of sales, for the employee retention credit extended to companies under the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the employee retention credit ). While the employee retention credit did not recur in fiscal year 2022, gross profit as a percentage of sales benefited from increased sales of higher-performance machines, improved leverage of fixed overhead costs and inflationary price increases implemented during fiscal year 2022. Operating Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2022 were 51.7 million, or 21 of sales, compared to 46.0 million, or 20 of sales, for fiscal year 2021, and included a favorable currency impact of 2.2 million, when translating foreign expenses to U.S. Dollars for financial reporting purposes. The year-over-year increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was driven primarily by increases in marketing and tradeshow expenses (particularly related to the International Manufacturing Technology Show in September 2022), sales commissions, and employee benefit and compensation costs, as well as increased one-time costs for administrative services. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses year-over-year also reflected the employee retention credit recorded in those expenses in fiscal year 2021 of 1.7 million, or 1 of sales. Operating Income (Loss). Operating income for fiscal year 2022 was 12.7 million, or 5 of sales, compared to an operating income of 10.2 million, or 4 of sales, for fiscal year 2021. The year-over-year increase in operating income for fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to increased sales of higher-performance machines and inflationary price increases implemented during fiscal year 2022. Operating income for fiscal year 2021 included a benefit of 2.9 million related to the employee retention credit. 
 37 

Other Expense, Net. Other expense, net for fiscal year 2022 increased by 1.3 million from fiscal year 2021, due mainly to an increase in foreign currency exchange losses. Provision for Income Taxes . We recorded an income tax expense of 3.7 million for fiscal year 2022, compared to income tax expense of 3.4 million for fiscal year 2021. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was 31 , compared to 33 for fiscal year 2021. The year-over-year change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to changes in geographic mix of income and loss that includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, various discrete tax items, and changes in income tax laws to address the unfavorable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Net Income (Loss). Net income for fiscal year 2022 was 8.2 million, or 1.23 per diluted share, compared to 6.8 million, or 1.01 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2021. The year-over-year increase in net income was primarily due to increased sales of higher-performance machines and inflationary price increases implemented during fiscal year 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources At October 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of 63.9 million, compared to 84.1 million at October 31, 2021. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily a result of increases in inventories . Approximately 31 of our 63.9 million of cash and cash equivalents is held in the U.S. The balance is attributable to our foreign operations and is held in the local currencies of our various foreign entities, subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic working capital needs. Working capital (including cash and cash equivalents) was 194.7 million at October 31, 2022, compared to 208.7 million at October 31, 2021. The decrease in working capital was primarily driven by decreases in cash and cash equivalents, prepaid assets, and accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in inventories and decreases in accounts payable and customer deposits. Inventories, net were 156.2 million at October 31, 2022, compared to 148.2 million at October 31, 2021. Inventory turns at October 31, 2022 of 1.2 remained the same as that at October 31, 2021. Capital expenditures were 2.2 million in fiscal year 2022, compared to 2.4 million in fiscal year 2021. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 were primarily for software development costs, purchases of factory equipment for production facilities, and purchases of general software and equipment for sales and service divisions. We funded these expenditures with cash flows from operations. On March 12, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program in an aggregate amount of up to 7.0 million. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions from time to time through March 10, 2023, subject to applicable laws, regulations and contractual provisions. The program may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not commit us to repurchase any shares of our common stock. During fiscal year 2022, we repurchased 2.9 million in shares of our common stock, and 4.1 million remained available under the program as of January 6, 2023. 
 38 

On January 6, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase program in an aggregate amount of up to 25.0 million. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time to time through November 10, 2024, subject to applicable laws, regulations and contractual provisions. The program may be amended, suspended, or discontinued at any time and does not commit us to repurchase any shares of our common stock. In addition, during fiscal year 2022, we paid cash dividends to our shareholders equal to 3.9 million. Future dividends are subject to approval of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, regulatory and contractual restrictions, our business strategy and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors from time to time. On December 31, 2018, we and our subsidiary Hurco B.V. entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as the lender, which was subsequently amended on each of March 13, 2020, December 23, 2020, December 17, 2021, and January 4, 2023 (as amended, the 2018 Credit Agreement ). The 2018 Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit and letter of credit facility in a maximum aggregate amount of 40.0 million. The 2018 Credit Agreement provides that the maximum amount of outstanding letters of credit at any one time may not exceed 10.0 million, the maximum amount of outstanding loans made to our subsidiary Hurco B.V. at any one time may not exceed 20.0 million, and the maximum amount of all outstanding loans denominated in alternative currencies at any one time may not exceed 20.0 million. Under the 2018 Credit Agreement, we and Hurco B.V. are borrowers, and certain of our other subsidiaries are guarantors. The scheduled maturity date of the 2018 Credit Agreement is December 31, 2023. Borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates based on, at our option, either (i) a rate based upon the secured overnight financing rate SOFR ), the Sterling Overnight Index Average Reference Rate, the Euro Interbank Offering Rate, or another alternative currency-based rate approved by the lender, depending on the term of the loan and the currency in which such loan is denominated, plus 1.00 per annum, or (ii) a base rate (which is the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , (b) the prime rate or (c) the one month SOFR-based rate plus 1.00 ), plus 0.00 per annum. Outstanding letters of credit will carry an annual rate of 1.00 . The 2018 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including covenants (1) restricting us from making certain investments, loans, advances and acquisitions (but permitting us to make investments in subsidiaries of up to 10.0 million); (2) restricting us from making certain payments, including (a) cash dividends, except that we may pay cash dividends as long as immediately before and after giving effect to such payment, the sum of the unused amount of the commitments under the 2018 Credit Agreement plus our cash on hand is not less than 10.0 million, and as long as we are not in default before and after giving effect to such dividend payments and (b) payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock, except that we may repurchase shares of our common stock as long as we are not in default before and after giving effect to such repurchases and the aggregate amount of payments made by us for all such repurchases during any fiscal year does not exceed 25.0 million; (3) requiring that we maintain a minimum working capital of 125.0 million; and (4) requiring that we maintain a minimum tangible net worth of 176.5 million. We may use the proceeds from advances under the 2018 Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes. In March 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan, HML, and China, NHML, closed on uncommitted revolving credit facilities with maximum aggregate amounts of 150 million New Taiwan Dollars and 32.5 million Chinese Yuan, respectively. As uncommitted facilities, both the Taiwan and China credit facilities are subject to review and termination by the respective underlying lending institution from time to time. 
 39 

As of October 31, 2022, our existing credit facilities consisted of the 1.5 million revolving credit facility in Germany, the 150 million New Taiwan Dollars Taiwan credit facility, the 32.5 million Chinese Yuan China credit facility, and the 40.0 million revolving credit facility under the 2018 Credit Agreement. We had no debt or borrowings under any of our credit facilities at October 31, 2022. At October 31, 2022, we had an aggregate of approximately 50.6 million available for borrowing under our credit facilities and were in compliance with all covenants relating thereto. We have an international cash pooling strategy that generally provides access to available cash deposits and credit facilities when needed in the U.S., Europe, or Asia Pacific. We believe our access to cash pooling and our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities provide adequate liquidity to fund our global operations over the next twelve months and beyond and allow us to remain committed to our strategic plan of product innovation, acquisitions, targeted penetration of developing markets, payment of dividends and our stock repurchase program. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy that prioritizes a strong balance sheet and liquidity position while recognizing the importance of accretive growth and returning value to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, where appropriate. As such, we continue to actively evaluate acquisition opportunities that support our long-term strategic plan. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following is a table of contractual obligations and commitments as of October 31, 2022 (in thousands): 

Payments Due by Period More Less than than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Operating leases 9,092 4,132 3,477 986 497 Accrued and deferred taxes and credits 5,444 38 802 509 4,095 Total 14,536 4,170 4,279 1,495 4,592 In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments disclosed above, we also have a variety of other obligations for the procurement of materials and services, none of which subject us to any material non-cancelable commitments. While some of these obligations arise under long-term supply agreements, we are not committed under these agreements to accept or pay for requirements that are not needed to meet our production needs. We have no material minimum purchase commitments or take-or-pay type agreements or arrangements. Unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of approximately 0.1 million, excluding any interest and penalties, have been excluded from the table above because we are unable to determine a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payment. We expect capital spending in fiscal year 2023 to be approximately 3.7 million, which includes investments for software development, leasehold improvement, factory equipment, and production facilities, as well as general software and equipment for selling facilities. We expect to fund these commitments with cash on hand and cash generated from operations.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements From time to time, our subsidiaries guarantee third party payment obligations in connection with the sale of machines to customers that use financing. We follow Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB guidance for accounting for guarantees (codified in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 460). As of October 31, 2022, we had nine outstanding third party payment guarantees totaling approximately 0.7 million. The terms of these guarantees are consistent with the underlying customer financing terms. Upon shipment of a machine, the customer assumes the risk of ownership. The customer does not obtain title, however, until the customer has paid for the machine. A retention of title clause allows us to recover the machine if the customer defaults on the financing. We accrue liabilities under these guarantees at fair value, which amounts are insignificant. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our accounting policies are frequently evaluated as our judgment and estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our judgments and estimates have a significant effect on the financial statements because they result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting estimates are those that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which involve significant subjectivity and judgment, and changes to such estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results. Therefore, we consider an understanding of the variability and judgment required in making these estimates and assumptions to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles arising from a business combination are reviewed for impairment annually as of the last day of our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently, if circumstances arise indicating potential impairment. We have no goodwill as of October 31, 2022. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks and trade names and are not material to our consolidated financial statement. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recovered through future net cash flows generated by the assets. We are not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of its finite-lived assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We are required periodically to review the recoverability of certain assets, including property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and goodwill, based on projections of anticipated future cash flows, including future profitability assessments of various product lines. We estimate cash flows using internal budgets based on recent sales data. We are not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. 
 41 

Inventories and Related Reserves We determine at each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be either unsalable or unsalable at its carrying cost. Reserves are established to effectively adjust the carrying value of such inventory to lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. To determine the appropriate level of valuation reserves, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products. We evaluate the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions, competitive offerings, and other factors on a regular basis. We have not experienced substantive write-offs due to obsolescence. Income Taxes We account for income taxes and the related accounts under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in each jurisdiction in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. These deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We operate in multiple jurisdictions through wholly-owned subsidiaries, and our global structure is complex. The estimates of our uncertain tax positions involve judgments and assessment of the potential tax implications. We recognize uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by relevant taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accordingly, the ultimate outcome with respect to taxes we may owe may differ from the amounts recognized. Our judgment regarding the realization of deferred tax assets may change due to future profitability and market conditions, change in U.S. or foreign tax laws, and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in Capitalized Software Development Costs Costs incurred to develop computer software products and significant enhancements to software features of existing products are capitalized as required by FASB guidance relating to accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, and such capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated product life of the related software. The determination as to when in the product development cycle technological feasibility has been established, and the expected product life, require judgments and estimates by management and can be affected by technological developments, innovations by competitors, and changes in market conditions affecting demand. We periodically review the carrying values of these assets and make judgments as to ultimate realization considering the above-mentioned risk factors. Derivative Financial Instruments Critical aspects of our accounting policy for derivative financial instruments that we designate as hedging instruments include conditions that require that critical terms of a hedging instrument are essentially the same as a hedged forecasted transaction. Another important element of our policy demands that formal documentation be maintained as required by FASB guidance relating to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Failure to comply with these conditions would result in a requirement to recognize changes in market value of hedge instruments in earnings. We routinely monitor significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments associated with derivative instruments and compliance with formal documentation requirements. Stock Compensation We account for share-based compensation according to FASB guidance relating to share-based payments, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date. This guidance requires that we estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant and recognize as expense the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the requisite service period.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Interest on borrowings under our bank credit agreements are tied to prevailing domestic and foreign interest rates. At October 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under any of our credit facilities. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk In fiscal year 2022, we derived approximately 62 of our revenues from customers located outside of the Americas, where we invoiced and received payments in several foreign currencies. All of our computerized machine tools and computer control systems, as well as certain proprietary service parts, are sourced by our U.S.-based engineering and manufacturing division and re-invoiced to our foreign sales and service subsidiaries, primarily in their functional currencies. Our products are sourced from foreign suppliers or built to our specifications by either our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan, the U.S., Italy, and China or an affiliated contract manufacturer in Taiwan. Our purchases are predominantly in foreign currencies and in some cases our arrangements with these suppliers include foreign currency risk sharing agreements, which reduce (but do not eliminate) the effects of currency fluctuations on product costs. The predominant portion of the exchange rate risk associated with our product purchases relates to the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts from time to time to hedge the cash flow risk related to forecasted inter-company sales and purchases denominated in, or based on, foreign currencies (primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling, and New Taiwan Dollar). We also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on inter-company receivables, payables, and loans denominated in foreign currencies. We do not speculate in the financial markets and, therefore, do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes. Forward contracts for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies as of October 31, 2022, which are designated as cash flow hedges under FASB guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, were as follows (in thousands, except weighted average forward rates): 

Contract Amount at Notional Weighted Forward Rates in Amount Avg. U.S. Dollars Forward in Foreign Forward Contract October 31, Contracts Currency Rate Date 2022 Maturity Dates Sale Contracts: Euro 18,750 1.0689 20,041 18,715 Nov 2022 - Oct 2023 Sterling 5,250 1.2342 6,479 6,053 Nov 2022 - Oct 2023 Purchase Contracts: New Taiwan Dollar 830,000 28.7542 28,865 25,993 Nov 2022 - Oct 2023 New Taiwan Dollars per U.S. Dollar

To manage this risk, we entered into a forward contract with a notional amount of 3.0 million in November 2021. We designated this forward contract as a hedge of our net investment in Euro denominated assets. We selected the forward method under the FASB guidance related to the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The forward method requires all changes in the fair value of the contract to be reported as a cumulative translation adjustment, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the same manner as the underlying hedged net assets. This forward contract matured in November 2022 and we entered into a new forward contract for the same notional amount that is set to mature in November 2023. As of October 31, 2022, we had 0.9 million of realized gain and 0.4 million of unrealized gain, net of tax, recorded as cumulative translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, related to these forward contracts. Forward contracts designated as net investment hedges under this guidance as of October 31, 2022, were as follows (in thousands, except weighted average forward rates):

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Hurco Companies, Inc. Management of Hurco Companies, Inc. (the Company has assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO). Management is responsible for the Company s financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, the Company s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Hurco Companies, Inc. Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hurco Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2022, and the related notes and schedule listed in Item 15(a) (collectively, the financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Basis for Opinions The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 46 

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Accounting for Income Taxes Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The Company operates in both the U.S. and international tax jurisdictions and has recorded deferred tax assets relating to deductible temporary differences, net operating losses and credit carryforwards of 9.8 million as of October 31, 2022, with an offsetting valuation allowance of 1.8 million. The deferred tax assets are further reduced by 4.7 million deferred tax liabilities in tax jurisdictions to record net deferred tax assets of 3.4 million and net deferred tax liabilities of 67 thousand. The Company reduces its deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based upon all the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management evaluated the ability to realize the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which involved applying complex tax regulations in federal, state, local and international tax jurisdictions. Management applied significant judgement in assessing the value of and realizability of its deferred tax assets and liabilities. In determining the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, management considers by jurisdiction all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, ability to utilize future carrybacks, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. We identified management s evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets, as a critical audit matter. The evaluation of gross deferred tax assets and liabilities involves complex tax regulations involving multiple tax jurisdictions. Assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets involves complexities of identifying and adhering to tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions, as well as the subjectivity of evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax assets. Auditing these elements required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our tax specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions related to the valuation allowance. Our audit procedures related to the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities included the following, among others: We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the Company s computation and evaluation of the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as valuation allowance and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness. We utilized tax specialists in both domestic and international tax to assist in: o Evaluating the appropriateness and accuracy of the deferred tax assets and liabilities by considering applicable tax law and underlying financial records; o Testing the projected future reversal of temporary differences by jurisdiction, including the underlying management assumptions; o Analyzing management s application of domestic and foreign tax laws to the Company s tax provisions; and evaluating i) the viability of contemplated tax planning strategies, and ii) the Company s assessment of its ability to carryback net operating losses and/or credits. 
 48 

We tested the completeness and accuracy of the data and inputs used to calculate the effective tax rate, current tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities. /s/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2017. January 6, 2023

independent agents and distributors throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. We also have our own direct sales and service organizations in China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and certain areas of the United States. We operate in the industrial equipment industry and have a global footprint that subjects us to various business risks in many different countries. During fiscal years 2020 through 2022, our operating results were adversely affected by the international business disruptions due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the economic slowdown in Europe, uncertainty surrounding the U.K. Brexit activities, political friction in the U.S, and geopolitical tensions, conflicts, and wars in Europe and Asia. Many of our customers deferred or eliminated investments in capital equipment in fiscal year 2020, which we attributed largely to the uncertainty these events created. During fiscal year 2021, our sales improved in all regions as countries began to lift the government-mandated COVID-19 stay-at-home orders or other similar operating restrictions. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have as significant an impact on our business and industry during fiscal year 2022, but intermittent lockdowns and similar restrictions in certain markets from time to time continue to impact our business, including those in China pursuant to its zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy. Because of the potential for extended vulnerability due to these and other factors, we have closely evaluated the estimates we have made in preparing the financial statements as of October 31, 2022, with the understanding that these estimates could change in the near term. We will continue to evaluate and disclose any uncertainty associated with key assumptions underlying fair value estimates, trends, and uncertainties that have had, or are reasonably expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for and at the end of each interim period. Credit Risk . We sell products to customers located throughout the world. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers and generally do not require collateral. Allowances are maintained for potential credit losses. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. Although a significant amount of trade receivables are with distributors primarily located in the United States, no single distributor or region represents a significant concentration of credit risk. Manufacturing Risk. At present, our wholly owned subsidiaries, Hurco Manufacturing Limited HML ), Ningbo Hurco Machine Tool Co., Ltd. NHML ), and Milltronics USA, Inc. Milltronics produce the vast majority of our machine tools for all three brands, Hurco, Milltronics, and Takumi. In addition, we manufacture electro mechanical components and accessories for machine tools through our wholly owned subsidiary, LCM. HML, NHML, Milltronics, and LCM manufacture their products in Taiwan, China, the U.S., and Italy, respectively. Any interruption in manufacturing at any of these locations would have an adverse effect on our financial operating results. Interruption in manufacturing at one of these locations could result from a change in the political environment, such as conflicts or wars; trade wars, blockages, embargoes, or tariffs; or a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami. Any interruption with one of our other third-party key suppliers may also have an adverse effect on our operating results and our financial condition.

The 2018 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including covenants (1) restricting us from making certain investments, loans, advances and acquisitions (but permitting us to make investments in subsidiaries of up to million); (2) restricting us from making certain payments, including (a) cash dividends, except that we may pay cash dividends as long as immediately before and after giving effect to such payment, the sum of the unused amount of the commitments under the 2018 Credit Agreement plus our cash on hand is not less than million, and as long as we are not in default before and after giving effect to such dividend payments and (b) payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock, except that we may repurchase shares of our common stock as long as we are not in default before and after giving effect to such repurchases and the aggregate amount of payments made by us for all such repurchases during any fiscal year does not exceed million; (3) requiring that we maintain a minimum working capital of million; and (4) requiring that we maintain a minimum tangible net worth of million. We may use the proceeds from advances under the 2018 Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes.

The terms of these guarantees are consistent with the underlying customer financing terms. Upon shipment of a machine, the customer assumes the risk of ownership. The customer does not obtain title, however, until it has paid for the machine. A retention of title clause allows us to recover the machine if the customer defaults on the financing. We accrue liabilities under these guarantees at fair value, which amounts are insignificant. We provide warranties on our products with respect to defects in material and workmanship. The terms of these warranties are generally for machines and shorter periods for service parts. We recognize a reserve with respect to this obligation at the time of product sale, with subsequent warranty claims recorded against the reserve. The amount of the warranty reserve is determined based on historical trend experience and any known warranty issues that could cause future warranty costs to differ from historical experience.

Most of the leased production and assembly facilities have lease terms ranging from two to , although the terms and conditions of our leases can vary significantly from lease to lease. We have assessed the specific terms and conditions of each lease to determine the amount of the lease payments and the length of the lease term, which includes the minimum period over which lease payments are required plus any renewal options that are both within our control to exercise and reasonably certain of being exercised upon lease commencement. In determining whether or not a renewal option is reasonably certain of being exercised, we assessed all relevant factors to determine if sufficient incentives exist as of lease commencement to conclude renewal is reasonably certain. There are no material residual value guarantees provided by us, nor any restrictions or covenants imposed by the leases to which we are a party. In determining the lease liability, we utilize our incremental borrowing rate to discount the future lease payments over the lease term to present value. We record a right-of-use asset and lease liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all leases for which we are a lessee, in accordance with ASC 842.
