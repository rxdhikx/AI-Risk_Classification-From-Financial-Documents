      " the ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into an initial business combination with a target. we may seek to enter into an initial business combination agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. if too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the initial business combination. furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred underwriting commissions (so that we are not subject to the sec s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred underwriting commissions or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into an initial business combination with us. the ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure. at the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. if our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third-party financing. in addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third-party financing. raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provisions of the class b common stock result in the issuance of class a shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the class b common stock at the time of our business combination. the above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. the amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the representative will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. the per-share amount we will distribute to stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the per-share value of shares held by non-redeeming stockholders will reflect our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions. because our trust account will initially contain 10.20 per share of class a common stock, public stockholders may be more incentivized to redeem their public shares at the time of our initial business combination. our trust account will initially contain 10.20 per share of class a common stock. this is different than some other similarly structured blank check companies for which the trust account will only contain 10.00 per share of class a common stock. as a result of the additional funds that could be available to public stockholders upon redemption of public shares, our public stockholders may be more incentivized to redeem their public shares and not to hold those shares of class a common stock through our initial business combination. a higher percentage of redemptions by our public stockholders could make it more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. the ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your stock. if our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. if our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. if you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your stock in the open market; however, at such time our stock may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. in either situation, \n",

      " you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your stock in the open market. the requirement that we complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating an initial business combination and may decrease our ability to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders. any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning an initial business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination by september 9, 2023 or seek a stockholder approved extension of such period. consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating an initial business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. this risk will increase as we get closer to the timeframe described above. in addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation. our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus covid-19 pandemic and the status of debt and equity markets. since december 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus that causes covid-19 has spread throughout the world, including the united states. on january 30, 2020, the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern. on january 31, 2020, u.s. health and human services secretary alex m. azar ii declared a public health emergency for the united states to aid the u.s. healthcare community in responding to covid-19, and on march 11, 2020, the world health organization characterized the covid-19 outbreak as a pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic has resulted, and other infectious diseases could result, in a widespread health crisis that has and will continue to adversely affect economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we consummate a business combination may also be materially and adversely affected. furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to covid-19 restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. the extent to which covid-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity and spread of covid-19 and the actions to contain covid-19 or treat its impact, among others. if the disruptions posed by covid-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected. in addition, our ability to coordinate as a team or to consummate a business combination may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing, which may be impacted by covid-19 and other events, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable or terms acceptable to us or at all. \n",

if third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than 10.20 per share and other risk factors below. if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, directors, officer, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or public warrants from public stockholders, which may influence a vote on a proposed initial business combination and reduce the public float of our class a common stock. if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officer, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. however, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. none of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions. such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. in the event that our sponsor, directors, officer, advisors or their affiliates purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. the purpose of such purchases could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination, or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. the purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. any such purchases will be reported pursuant to section 13 and section 16 of the exchange act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. in addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our class a common stock or public warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to obtain or maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. \n",

      " if a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed. we will comply with the tender offer rules or proxy rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. despite our compliance with these rules, if a stockholder fails to receive our tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, such stockholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. in addition, proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or redeem public shares, which may include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself. for example, we may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the initial vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically. in the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures, its shares may not be redeemed. you will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies. since the net proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been identified, we may be deemed to be a blank check company under the u.s. securities laws. however, because we have net tangible assets in excess of 5,000,000 upon the successful completion of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants and filed a current report on form 8-k, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the sec to protect investors in blank check companies, such as rule 419. accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. among other things, this means our units will be immediately tradable and we will have a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to rule 419. moreover, if the initial public offering were subject to rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination. because of our special purpose acquisition company structure and limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. if we do not complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.20 per share on our redemption of our public shares, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless. we expect to encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. many of these competitors possess similar technical, human and other resources to ours, and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. while we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds from the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. this inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. furthermore, because we are obligated to pay cash for the shares of class a common stock which our public stockholders redeem in connection with our initial business combination, target companies will be aware that this may present closing risk by reducing the resources available to us for our initial business combination. additionally, potential target companies may be less inclined to consummate a transaction with us because definitive documentation for such a transaction will preclude any recourse against our trust account, meaning that potential counterparties may determine that they do not have adequate contractual remedies in the event a transaction fails to close. these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. if we do not complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.20 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. in certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than 10.20 per share upon our liquidation. see - if third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than 10.20 per share and other risk factors below. \n",

initial business combination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business s operations. we may pursue business combination opportunities in any industry, sector or geographic area, except that we will not, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. because we have not yet selected or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. to the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. for example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. although our officer and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. we also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. accordingly, any holders who choose to retain their securities following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. such holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. as the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. this could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business combination. in recent years, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered into an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies preparing for an initial public offering, as well as many such companies currently in registration. as a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available to consummate an initial business combination. in addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals or business models may increase, which could cause targets companies to demand improved financial terms. attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. this could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial business combination, and may result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors altogether. we may seek business combination opportunities in industries or sectors which may or may not be outside of our management team s area of expertise. although we intend to focus on identifying companies at the intersection of the artificial intelligence and healthcare industries, we will consider an initial business combination outside of our management team s area of expertise if an initial business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive business combination opportunity for our company or we are unable to identify a suitable candidate in this sector after having expanded a reasonable amount of time and effort in an attempt to do so. although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. we also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors in the initial public offering than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in an initial business combination candidate. in the event we elect to pursue a business combination outside of the areas of our management team s expertise, our management team s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this form 10-k regarding the areas of our management team s expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we

abandon a particular business combination. if we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. we have not selected any specific business combination target but intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds from the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants. as a result, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. to the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. further, the amount of additional financing we may be required to obtain could increase as a result of future growth capital needs for any particular transaction, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to repurchase for cash a significant number of public shares from stockholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination and/or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase public shares in connection with our initial business combination. if we do not complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.20 per share plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes on the liquidation of our trust account, and our warrants will expire worthless. in addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. the failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. none of our officer, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. if we do not complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive approximately 10.20 per share on the liquidation of our trust account, and our warrants will expire worthless. furthermore, as described in the risk factor entitled if third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than 10.20 per share, under certain circumstances our public stockholders may receive less than 10.20 per share upon the liquidation of the trust account. we may seek business combination opportunities with a high degree of complexity that require significant operational improvements, which could delay or prevent us from achieving our desired results. we may seek business combination opportunities with large, highly complex companies that we believe would benefit from operational improvements. while we intend to implement such improvements, to the extent that our efforts are delayed or we are unable to achieve the desired improvements, the business combination may not be as successful as we anticipate. to the extent we complete our initial business combination with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenues or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine. these risks include volatile revenues or earnings and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. although our officer and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors and we may not have adequate time to complete due diligence. furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. we may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may affect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business s management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. our assessment of the capabilities of the target s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. should the target s management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. \n",

if that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. third, if we call the public warrants for redemption under certain circumstances, warrant holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption. in the event of an exercise on a cashless basis, a holder would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of class a common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of class a common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the fair market value of our class a common stock (defined above) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value and the number of shares of our class a common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised the warrant for cash. this will have the effect of reducing the potential upside of the holder s investment in our company because the warrant holder will hold a smaller number of shares of our class a common stock upon a cashless exercise of the warrants they hold. any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. we will seek to complete an initial business combination with companies at the intersection of the artificial intelligence and healthcare industries, but may also pursue other business combination opportunities, except that we will not, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. because we have not yet selected or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. to the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. for example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. although our officer and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. for instance, changes in governmental policies in the united states or other jurisdictions in which any specific target business operates may change following our initial business combination, which could result in increased regulations, reduced demand for government spending, including healthcare spending, or other factors inherent in the industry in which the target business operates. we also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officer or directors of a duty \n",

become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. following the completion of the initial public offering and until we consummate our initial business combination, we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. certain members of management team are, and may in the future become, affiliated with entities (such as operating companies or investment vehicles) that are engaged in a similar business, although our officer may not participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other special purpose acquisition companies with a class of securities registered under the exchange act until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination by september 9, 2023. there could be overlap between companies that would be suitable for a business combination with us and companies that present an attractive investment opportunity for our sponsor and/or the members of our management team. members of our management team also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties. any such opportunities may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, and members of our management team may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. these conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. in addition, our sponsor and members of our management team, may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to completion of our initial business combination. as a result, our sponsor, and members of our management could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. however, we do not believe that any potential conflicts of interest with respect to such other special purpose acquisition companies would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination because our management team has significant experience in identifying and executing multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously and we are not limited by industry or geography in terms of the acquisition opportunities we can pursue. unlike many other similarly structured blank check companies, our initial stockholders will receive additional shares of class a common stock if we issue shares to consummate an initial business combination. the founder shares will automatically convert into class a common stock at the time of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holders, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as provided herein. in the case that additional shares of class a common stock, or equity-linked securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for class a common stock, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in our initial public offering and related to the closing of the initial business combination, the ratio at which founder shares shall convert into class a common stock will be adjusted so that the number of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, approximately 20 of the sum of (i) the total number of all outstanding shares of common stock upon completion of the initial public offering, plus (ii) all shares of class a common stock and equity-linked securities issued, or deemed issued in connection with the initial business combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination, and any private placement-equivalent warrants issued to our sponsor or its affiliates upon conversion of loans made to us). this is different from most other similarly structured blank check companies in which the initial stockholder will only be issued an aggregate of 20 of the total number of shares to be outstanding prior to the initial business combination.

complete a business combination transaction. specifically, to comply with the safe harbor, the spac rule proposals would require a company to file a report on form 8-k announcing that it has entered into an agreement with a target company for an initial business combination no later than eighteen (18) months after the effective date of the registration statement for its initial public offering ipo registration statement ). the company would then be required to complete its initial business combination no later than twenty-four (24) months after the date of the registration statement for its initial public offering. we understand that the sec has recently been taking informal positions regarding the investment company act consistent with the spac rule proposals. there is currently uncertainty concerning the applicability of the investment company act to a spac, including a company like ours, which does not complete its initial business combination within the proposed time frame set forth in the proposed safe harbor rule. as indicated above, we completed the ipo in november 2021 and have operated as a blank check company searching for a target business with which to consummate an initial business combination since such time (or approximately sixteen (16) months after the effective date of the ipo, as of the date of this report). as a result, it is possible that a claim could be made that we have been operating as an unregistered investment company if the spac rule proposals are adopted as proposed. if we were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the investment company act, we might be forced to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead be required to liquidate the company. if we are required to liquidate the company, our investors would not be able to realize the benefits of owning shares in a successor operating business, including the potential appreciation in the value of our shares and warrants or rights following such a transaction, and our warrants or rights would expire worthless. the funds in the trust account have, since the ipo, been held only in u.s. government securities, within the meaning set forth in section 2(a)(16) of the investment company act, with a maturity of one hundred eighty-five (185) days or less or in money market funds investing solely in u.s. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under rule 2a-7 under the investment company act. as of december 31, 2022, amounts held in trust account included approximately 3,044,672 of accrued interest. in addition, even prior to the twenty-four- (24) month anniversary of the effective date of the ipo registration statement, we may be deemed to be an investment company. the longer that the funds in the trust account are held in short-term u.s. government securities or in money market funds invested exclusively in such securities, even prior to the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the effective date of the ipo registration statement, there is a greater risk that we may be considered an unregistered investment company, in which case we may be required to liquidate. accordingly, we may determine, in our discretion, to liquidate the securities held in the trust account at any time, even prior to the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the effective date of the ipo registration statement, and instead hold all funds in the trust account in cash, which would further reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any redemption or our liquidation. if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a group of stockholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15 of our class a common stock, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15 of our class a common stock. if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under section 13 of the exchange act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in the initial public offering without our prior consent, which

(3) all founder shares held by our initial stockholders would automatically convert into class a common stock upon completion of our initial business combination. \n",
      " based on these assumptions, each share of class a common stock would have an implied value of 1.21 per share upon completion of our initial business combination, representing an approximate 88 decrease from the initial implied value of 10.00 per public share. as a result, even if the trading price of our class a common stock significantly declines, the value of the founder shares held by our initial stockholders will be significantly greater than the amount our initial stockholders paid to purchase such shares. in addition, our initial stockholders could potentially recoup their entire investment in our company even if the trading price of our class a common stock after the initial business combination is as low as 1.79 per share. as a result, our initial stockholders are likely to earn a substantial profit on their investment in us upon disposition of their class a common stock even if the trading price of our class a common stock declines after we complete our initial business combination even if the value of the public shares declines significantly. our initial stockholders may therefore be economically incentivized to complete an initial business combination with a riskier, weaker-performing or less-established target business than would be the case if our initial stockholders had paid the same per share price for the founder shares as our public stockholders paid for their public shares. this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provisions of the founder shares result in the issuance of class a common stock on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the founder shares at the time of our initial business combination and would become exacerbated to the extent that public stockholders seek redemptions from the trust for their public shares. in addition, because of the anti-dilution protection in the founder shares, any equity or equity-linked securities issued in connection with our initial business combination would be disproportionately dilutive to our class a common stock. \n",

changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination. we issued an aggregate of 20,630,000 warrants in connection with the initial public offering (comprised of the 10,350,000 warrants included in the units and the 10,280,000 private placement warrants). the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and, as such, the warrants must be recorded as derivative liability. we will record at fair value upon issuance any changes in fair value each period reported in earnings as determined by us based upon a valuation report obtained from an independent third party valuation firm. the impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock, including as a result of increased volatility in our earnings due to fluctuations in the value of the warrants as well as increased costs associated with obtaining such valuations. in addition, potential targets may seek a spac that does not have warrants that are accounted for as a warrant liability, which may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business. we may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless. we have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of 0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of our class a common stock equals or exceeds 18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like and certain issuances of class a common stock and equity-linked securities) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we give proper notice of such redemption and provided certain other conditions are met. if and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. none of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees. none of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us (subject to certain exceptions) so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees. our warrants and founder shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination. we issued warrants to purchase 10,350,000 shares of class a common stock as part of the units issued in the initial public offering and, simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we issued in a private placement warrants to purchase an aggregate of 10,280,000 private placement warrants at 1.00 per share. our initial stockholders, including our sponsor, currently own an aggregate of 4,975,000 founder shares. the founder shares are convertible into shares of class a common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as set forth herein. in addition, if our sponsor makes any working capital loans, up to 2,000,000 of such loans may be converted into warrants, at the price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. such warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. to the extent we issue shares of class a common stock to effectuate an initial business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of class a common stock upon exercise of these warrants and conversion rights could make us a less attractive business combination vehicle to a target business. any such issuance will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our class a common stock and reduce the value of the shares of class a common stock issued to complete the initial business combination. therefore, our warrants and founder shares may make it more difficult to effectuate an initial business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. \n",

the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60 of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and the market value is below 9.20 per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted to be equal to 115 of the higher of the market value and the newly issued price, and the 18.00 per share redemption trigger prices described below under description of securities - redeemable warrants - public stockholders warrants - redemption of warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the market value and the newly issued price. this may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business. certain agreements related to our initial public offering may be amended without stockholder approval. each of the agreements related to our initial public offering to which we are a party, other than the warrant agreement (except for provisions of the warrant agreement enabling amendments without stockholder or warrant holder approval that are necessary in the good faith determination of our board of directors (taking into account then existing market precedents) to allow for the warrants to be classified as equity in our financial statements) and the investment management trust agreement, may be amended without stockholder approval. such agreements are: the underwriting agreement; the letter agreement among us and our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors; the registration rights agreement among us and our initial stockholders; and the private placement warrants purchase agreement between us and our sponsor. provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our class a common stock and could entrench management. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. these provisions include a staggered board of directors, the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock, and the fact that prior to the completion of our initial business combination only holders of shares of our class b common stock, which may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. we are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. together these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. \n",

      " the warrants may become exercisable and redeemable for a security other than the shares of class a common stock, and you will not have any information regarding such other security at this time. in certain situations, including if we are not the surviving entity in our initial business combination, the warrants may become exercisable for a security other than the shares of class a common stock. as a result, if the surviving company redeems your warrants for securities pursuant to the warrant agreement, you may receive a security in a company of which you do not have information at this time. pursuant to the warrant agreement, the surviving company will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to register the issuance of the security underlying the warrants within 20 business days of the closing of an initial business combination. the grant of registration rights to our initial equity holders may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights, particularly in the event that our class a common stock exceeds 12.00 per share for a period of time after our initial business combination, may adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock. pursuant to an agreement to be entered into concurrently with the issuance and sale of the securities in the initial public offering, our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the shares of class a common stock into which are founder shares are convertible, the private placement warrants, the shares of class a common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants held, or to be held, by them, and holders of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register such warrants or the class a common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants. we will bear the cost of registering these securities. the lock-up provisions on our founder shares may be removed subsequent to our initial business combination if the last reported sale price of our class a common stock equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination. consequently, at such time (which may be earlier than one year after our initial business combination), our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees may transfer and demand registration of the founder shares and shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion thereof when our class a common stock trades at a marginal premium to the initial offering price , thereby compounding the potential dilution to our public stockholders. the registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock. in addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. this is because the stockholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our class a common stock that is expected when the securities owned by our initial stockholders or holders of working capital loans or their respective permitted transferees are registered. the excise tax included in the inflation reduction act of 2022 may decrease the value of our securities, hinder our ability to consummate an initial business combination, and decrease the amount of funds available for distribution in connection with a liquidation. on august 16, 2022, president biden signed into law the inflation reduction act of 2022 (the inflation reduction act ), which, among other things, imposes a 1 excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by a domestic corporation beginning in 2023, with certain exceptions (the excise tax ). because we are a delaware corporation and our securities trade on the nasdaq stock market, we are a covered corporation within the meaning of the inflation reduction act. while not free from doubt, it is possible that the excise tax will apply to any redemptions of our common stock after december 31, 2022, including redemptions in connection with an initial business combination and any amendment to our certificate of incorporation to extend the time to consummate an initial business combination, unless an exemption is available. issuances of securities in connection with an initial business combination transaction (including any pipe transaction at the time of an initial business combination) are expected to reduce the amount of the excise tax in connection with redemptions occurring in the same taxable year (generally by the value of the securities issued), but the value of the securities redeemed may exceed the value of the securities issued. consequently, the value of your investment in our securities may decrease as a result of the excise tax. in addition, the excise tax may make a transaction with us less appealing to potential business combination targets, and thus potentially hinder our ability to enter into and consummate an initial business combination, particularly an initial business combination in which substantial pipe issuances are not contemplated. further, the application of the excise tax in the event of a liquidation is uncertain absent further guidance. \n",

company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act. we will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. even if the post-transaction company owns 50 or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. for example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of class a common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. in this case, we would acquire a 100 interest in the target. however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction. in addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company s stock than we initially acquired. accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target business. we cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. we are dependent upon our executive officer and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate. our

      " laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination and results of operations. we are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the securities act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies. we are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the securities act, as modified by the jobs act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. as a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. we could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the aggregate worldwide market value of our class a common stock held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded 700.0 million as of any june 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following december 31. we cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. if some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. further, section 102(b)(1) of the jobs act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a securities act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the exchange act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. the jobs act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. we have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. this may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in item 10(f)(1) of regulation s-k. smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. we will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the aggregate worldwide market value of our class a common stock held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded 250 million as of the prior june 30th, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded 100 million during such completed fiscal year or the aggregate worldwide market value of our class a common stock held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded 700 million as of the prior june 30th. to the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements and other disclosures with other public companies difficult or impossible. item 1b\n"
