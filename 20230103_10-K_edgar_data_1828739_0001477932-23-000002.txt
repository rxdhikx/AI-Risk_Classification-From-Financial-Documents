MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 4 | Page Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATION As of September 30, 2022, we had deficit of 51,203. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. Year ended September 30, 202 2 compared to year ended September 30, 2021 Operating Expenses During the year ended September 30, 2022, we incurred total expenses and professional fees of 32,466 compared to 17,705 for the year ended September 30, 2021. General and administrative and professional fee expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting. Net Loss Our net loss for the year ended September 30, 2022 was 32,466 compared to 17,705 for the year ended September 30, 2021. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As at September 30, 2022 our total assets were 5,676 compared to 14,178 in total assets at September 30, 2021. As at September 30, 2022, our current liabilities were 25,734 compared to 1,770 as of September 30, 2021. Stockholders deficit was 20,058 as of September 30, 2022 compared to stockholders equity of 12,408 as of September 30, 2021. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended September 30, 2022, net cash flows used in operating activities was 22,466, consisting of net loss of 32,466 and 10,000 of accounts payable. For the year ended September 30, 2021, net cash flows used in operating activities was 17,705 consisting entirely of net loss of 17,705. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended September 30, 2022 were 13,964, consisting of loan from shareholder compared to 27,095 for the year ended September 30, 2021, consisting of loan from shareholder of 750 and proceeds from issuance of common shares of 26,345. 5 | Page Table of Contents PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. MATERIAL COMMITMENTS As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments. PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Azzurro Solutions Corp. as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, cash flows, and the related notes (collectively referred to as financial statements for the periods then ended. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Going Concern As described further in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses from inception through September 30, 2022, and expects to incur additional losses in the future. We determined the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter due to the estimation and uncertainty regarding the Company s future cash flows and the risk of bias in management s judgments and assumptions in estimating these cash flows. Our audit procedures related to the Company s assertion on its ability to continue as a going concern included the following, among others: We reviewed the Company s working capital and liquidity ratios and forecasted revenue, operating expenses, and uses and sources of cash used in management s assessment of whether the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least one year from the financial statement issuance date. This testing included inquiries with management, comparison of prior period forecasts to actual results, consideration of positive and negative evidence impacting management s forecasts, the Company s financing arrangements in place as of the report date, market and industry factors and consideration of the Company s relationships with its financing partners. F-1 Table of Contents Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #2 to the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note #2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /S/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

F-6 Table of Contents AZZURRO SOLUTIONS CORP. NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (OCTOBER 4, 2019) TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 . These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Further to above, In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in China, which initially been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and subsequently as Pandemic by the World Health Organization. The Company is not able to predict the ultimate impact that COVID -19 will have on its business; however, if the current economic conditions continue, the Company will be forced to significantly scale back its business operations and its growth plans, and could ultimately have a significant negative impact on the Company.

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year September 30, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
