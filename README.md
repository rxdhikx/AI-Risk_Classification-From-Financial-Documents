# AI Risk Classification From Financial Documents of US SEC 

The objective of this project is to classify the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI) technologies based on corporate financial disclosure texts, specifically the financial statements of U.S. public firms. 

As AI continues to gain popularity, U.S. firms increasingly adopt AI technologies to boost revenue by integrating AI into their business or products and to reduce costs by automating tasks traditionally performed by human labor. 

However, these opportunities come with inherent risks. In this project, we try to develop methods to efficiently improve the process of analysing corporate AI risk exposure by examining the annual financial reports of these firms. These reports provide insights from firm executives on potential risk factors affecting their business.

Tech Stack: NLP, BERT, Python, Pandas, Numpy, NLTK (punkt)
