EXPLANATORY NOTE 

This Amendment No. 1 to Form 10-K (this Form 10-K/A)
amends Part I of the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Liberty Resources Acquisition Corp., Inc., a Delaware corporation Liberty, 
 we, us, the registrant or the Company, including our subsidiaries, as applicable),
for the year ended December 31, 2021 that we originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 31, 2022 (the Original Filing) to disclose that our Sponsor, Liberty Fields LLC, is controlled by one or more non-US persons
and therefore may constitute a foreign person under CFIUS rules and regulation. As such, the pool of potential targets
that we may complete an initial business combination with may be limited. The Original Filing has been amended to disclose that the time
necessary for government review of the initial business combination or a decision to prohibit the initial business combination could prevent
us from completing an initial business combination and require us to liquidate should we be subject to CFIUS review. 

In addition, pursuant to Rule 12b-15 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, this Form 10-K/A also contains new certifications by the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer in Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and 32.2 as required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

Except as set forth in this Form 10-K/A, this Form 10-K/A
does not amend or otherwise update any other information in the Original Filing. Other than the information specifically amended and restated
herein, this Form 10-K/A does not reflect events occurring after March 31, 2022, the date of the Original Filing, or modify
or update those disclosures that may have been affected by subsequent events. Accordingly, this Form 10-K/A should be read in conjunction
with the Original Filing and with our filings with the SEC after the Original Filing. 

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS; SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS 

This Annual Report contains statements that constitute
forward-looking statements which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements
that are not historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Some of the statements in this Annual Report constitute forward-looking statements because they
relate to future events or our future performance or future financial condition. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts,
but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our company, our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions.
Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team s expectations,
hopes, beliefs, intentions, or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other
characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, 
 believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, 
 may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, 
 should, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words
does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report may include, for example, statements
about: 

our ability to select an appropriate target business or businesses; 

our ability to complete our initial business combination; 

our expectations around the performance of the prospective target business or businesses; 

our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors
following our initial business combination; 

our officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts
of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination; 

our potential ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination; 

our pool of prospective target businesses; 

the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities; 

our public securities potential liquidity and trading; 

2 

our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and any material
weaknesses of the foregoing; 

the lack of a market for our securities; 

the use of proceeds not held in the trust account or available to us from interest income on the trust
account balance; 

the trust account not being subject to claims of third parties; or 

our financial performance. 

The forward-looking statements contained in this
Annual Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There
can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve
a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance
to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include,
but are not limited to, those factors described under the section of this Annual Report entitled Risk Factors . Should one
or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material
respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities
laws. 

We use words such as anticipates, 
 believes, expects, intends, seeks, plans, estimates, 
 targets and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this
Annual Report involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking
statements for any reason, including the factors set forth in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in this
Annual Report. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which
these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the
forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate
new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and
other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statements in this Annual Report should not be regarded as a representation
by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. 

We have based the forward-looking statements included
in this Annual Report on information available to us on the date of this Annual Report, and we assume no obligation to update any such
forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may
make directly to you or through reports that we may file in the future with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ),
including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. 

Summary of Risk Factors 

An investment in our securities involves a high
degree of risk. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in the section titled Risk Factors , 
alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating
results. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks
include, but are not limited to: 

Our public stockholders may not be afforded an
opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though
a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination. 

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial stockholders and members
of our management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote. 

Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may
be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash. 

3 

The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition
unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a
target. 

The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of
our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure. 

The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of
our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait
for liquidation in order to redeem your shares. 

The requirement that we complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial
business combination may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time
we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could
undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders. 

We may not be able to complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial
business combination, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public
shares and liquidate, in which case our public stockholders may only receive 10.15 per unit, or less than such amount in certain circumstances. 

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial stockholders, directors,
executive officers, advisors and their respective affiliates may elect to purchase shares from public stockholders, which may influence
a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our Class A common stock. 

If a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our
initial business combination or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed. 

You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies. 

Subsequent to the completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs
or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition,
results of operations and our share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment. 

The officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business
combination. The loss of a business combination target s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability
of our post-combination business. 

Our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination.
Upon the loss of control of a target business, new management may not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably
operate such business. 

We are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability
to operate. 

Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will
be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. The loss
of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. 

Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors ability
to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 

4 

Our sponsor paid an aggregate of 25,000, or approximately 0.009 per founder share, and, accordingly,
you will experience immediate and substantial dilution from the purchase of the shares of our Class A common stock. 

Since our sponsor paid only approximately 0.009 per share for the founder shares, our officers and directors
could potentially make a substantial profit even if we acquire a target business that subsequently declines in value. 

We are a recently incorporated company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis
on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective. 

Past performance by our sponsor and our management team including their affiliates and including the businesses
referred to herein, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us or in the future performance of any business that
we may acquire. 

Our sponsor, Liberty Fields LLC, is
controlled by non-U.S. person and has substantial ties to non-U.S. persons in Malaysia. As much, we may not be able to complete an initial
business combination with a U.S. target company since such initial business combination may be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations
and review by a U.S. government entity such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and ultimately prohibited. 

PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the
 Form 10-K ), references to the Company and to we, us, our and
refer to Liberty Resources Acquisition Corp. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware
on April 22, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock
purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination ). We are
an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. 

We believe that there are many target companies
that could become attractive public companies we intend to focus on industries that complement our management team s background,
and to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify and acquire a business, focusing on the oil and gas sectors, where
our management team has extensive experience. 

Our management team is led by our Chief Executive
Officer, Dato Maznah Binti Abdul Jalil, who has over 30 years of investment banking experience in a merchant Bank and DRB-HICOM
Berhad Group of Companies. She is currently working as a director at several companies, including: Malayan Flour Mill Berhad MFLOUR ),
since November 2019, Boustead Heavy Industrial Corporation Berhad BHIC ), since August 2019, Innature Berhad INNATURE ), since March 2019, Lembaga Angkatan Tentera LTAT ), since November 2018, Opus Asset Management
SDN. BHD, since November 2017, and Pavilion REIT Management SDN. BHD, since July 2011. From December 2012 until April 2019
she was the Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer of Sona Petroleum Berhad. From 2007 to 2011 she held two positions, one as
Executive Vice President at Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad and as Head of Corporate Finance at Hong Leong Financial Group. Prior to that
she worked 14 years as Senior Group Director in Corporate Finance Advisory at DRB-HICOM BERHAD (From June 1992 to
July 2005) where she was responsible of corporate finance advisory work for Master-Carriage Group and DRB-HICOM Group
including restructuring proposals of companies mergers and acquisitions floatation of companies and overseeing investment related
activities of the Group. She previously held several directorships in publicly listed companies as well as non-listed companies. 

The Company s sponsor is Liberty Fields
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor ). The registration statement for the Company s Initial Public
Offering was declared effective on November 3, 2021. On November 8, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering
of 10,000,000 units (the Units and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units being offered, the
 Public Shares ), at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 100,000,000 (see Note 6) (the Initial Public
Offering ). The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 Units at the Initial Public
Offering price to cover over-allotments, if any. 

5 

Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing
of the Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 477,775 units (the Placement Units to
the Sponsor at a price of 10.00 per Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of 4,777,750 (the Private Placement ). 

Subsequently, on November 8, 2021, the underwriters
exercised the over-allotment option in full, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units occurred (the Over-allotment
Option Units ). The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 1,500,000 units at a price of 10.00 per unit resulted in total gross
proceeds of 1,500,000. On November 8, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-allotment Option Units, the Company consummated
the private sale of an additional 52,500 Placement Units, generating gross proceeds of 525,000. The Placement Units were issued pursuant
to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering. 

A total of 116,725,000, comprised of the proceeds
from the Offering and the proceeds of private placements that closed on November 8, 2021, net of the underwriting commissions, discounts,
and offering expenses, was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company s public stockholders. 

Our Business Strategy 

We believe that acquiring a leading high-growth
company or assets in the natural resources, oil, or gas industry will provide a platform to fund consolidation and fuel growth for our
company. There is no restriction in the geographic location of targets we can pursue, although we intend to initially prioritize Central
Asia as the geographical focus. Our aim is to become a mid-size independent operator targeting producing onshore assets with attractive
fiscal regimes and offers a high dividend policy 

We believe that there is a large pool of quality
initial business combination targets looking for exit opportunities with an increasing number of private equity (or PE) and venture capital
(or VC) activities in the certain regions, which provides us opportunities given what we believe are the limited exit options for mid-market
companies in the region. We believe that there are many resources in Central Asia that have been left stranded because domestic investors
have less access to cheap capital. This is reflected in the high interest rates in a number of prospective regions, as indicated below: 

Kazakhstan 
 9.3 
 
 Uzbekistan 
 14.0 
 
 Azerbaijan 
 13.9 
 
 Tajikstan 
 13.0 
 
 Turkmenistan 
 12.0 
 
 Kyrgystan 
 7.5 

In addition, these same countries face volatile
exchange rates, further increasing the difficulty in securing foreign funding / loans. 

6 

As noted, we believe that the natural resources
industry, specifically the oil and gas sectors, represent a particularly attractive deal sourcing environment that will allow us to leverage
our team s skill sets and experience to identify an initial business combination which can potentially serve as a strong platform
for future add-on acquisitions. Our investment thesis is supported by what we believe are the following trends in our target sectors: 

Strong
Core Industry Fundamental: Despite the uncertainties, we believe that the U.S. oil and gas sectors can be profitably developed
and/or produced at low break-even costs. As such, drilling and other exploration and production focused investments will continue to present
viable opportunities to investors in 2021. Additionally, we believe that natural gas is generally viewed as a bridge fuel to more sustainable
and environmentally friendly forms of electrical generation. The U.S. has recently become a leader in natural gas resource development
and is a growing LNG exporter. We believe that investors have fundamentally changed their investment criteria for the exploration and
production industry from high production growth targets to disciplined growth, focusing primarily on total returns and returns of cash
to investors. The U.S. upstream sector is in a period of evolutionary change. We believe that the operators that accept the new climate
and evolve to meet the challenges of 2021 and beyond will emerge successfully, strengthened by their resilient business models in the
face of commodity price fluctuations, and serve a vital role in providing for the world s energy needs. 

Targeting
of Fastest Growing Industries. The main industry we are targeting is the natural resources industry, specifically the oil
and gas sectors. This is not just a function of our expertise in these fields, but it is also because these sectors are highly fragmented
with hundreds of companies ranging from large established corporations to smaller start-ups. Many non-investment grade companies have
struggled with excess leverage and have been forced to restructure their operations, while other companies have sought to reduce their
leverage through asset sales. Historically, the exploration and production industry has used asset sales as one of its key sources of
funding. The lack of access to capital and an active M A market lead us to believe that many companies within our target industries
currently lack the financial health and operating capabilities to succeed in today s environment. 

7 

Lack
of Competition. Recent sustained low commodity prices have deeply impacted the financial health and access to capital for
both public and private companies within our target sectors. We believe the exodus of capital providers and changing market sentiments
have created an opportunity for natural resources focused SPACs to fill the void and pursue acquisition targets in a buyer s market. 

Operator-Led
SPACs outperform their Sectors: According to McKinsey Company, SPACs that are led by executives with past C-Suite experience
tend to outperform other SPACs (by about 40 and their industry peers (by about 10 after at least 18 months of publicly available
trading data. 

Our Acquisition Criteria 

Consistent with our strategy, we have identified
the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these
criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with
a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 

Target Size : Consistent with our investment thesis as described above, we plan to target
businesses with total enterprise values ranging from 200.0 million to 2.0 billion in the natural resources industry, specifically within
the oil and gas sectors. 

Ownership : Liberty plans to outsource most of its downstream activities and prefers to use
cash for dividends payments or new fields acquisition. We also propose to pursue an asset light policy while maintaining an optimal asset
ownership plan. But at the same time, we will maintain a high degree of management control over the assets within acquired fields. Such
an asset light strategy offers higher profit and greater flexibility for the Company. 

Businesses with Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential . We will seek to acquire one or more
businesses that have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of increased production capacity,
expense reduction, and synergistic follow-on acquisitions resulting in increased operating leverage. 

Businesses with Potential for Strong Free Cash Flow Generation . We will seek to acquire
one or more businesses that have the potential to generate strong, stable, and increasing free cash flow. We intend to focus on one or
more businesses that have predictable revenue streams and definable low working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We may also
seek to prudently leverage this cash flow in order to enhance stockholder value. 

Strong Management . We will seek companies with strong management teams already in place.
We will spend significant time assessing a company s leadership and human fabric and maximizing its efficiency over time. 

Benefit from Being a Public Company . We intend to acquire one or more businesses that
will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated
with being a publicly traded company. 

Appropriate Valuations and Upside Potential . We intend to apply rigorous, criteria-based,
disciplined, and valuation-centric metrics. We intend to acquire a target on terms that we believe provide significant upside potential
while seeking to limit risk to our investors. 

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive.
Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general
guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that from time to time our management may deem relevant. 

8 

Our Acquisition Process 

In evaluating a potential target business, we
expect to conduct a comprehensive due diligence review to seek to determine a company s quality and its intrinsic value. That due
diligence review may include, among other things, financial statement analysis, detailed document reviews, technology diligence, multiple
meetings with management, consultations with relevant industry and academic experts, competitors, customers and suppliers, as well as
a review of additional information that we will seek to obtain as part of our analysis of a target company. 

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial
business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our
initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent
directors, will obtain an opinion from either an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a
financial point of view. Furthermore, in the event that we seek such a business combination, we expect that the independent members of
our board of directors would be involved in the process for considering and approving the transaction. 

Members of our management team, including our
officers and directors, will directly or indirectly own our securities following this offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of
interest in determining whether a particular target company is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination.
Each of our officers and directors, as well as our management team, may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular
business combination, including if the retention or resignation of any such officers, directors, and management team members was included
by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to such business combination. 

We have not selected any specific business combination
target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business
combination target. 

Each of our directors, director nominees and officers
presently have and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which
such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or
directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary
or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity.
We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our
ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination. 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly
offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, and such opportunity is one we are legally
and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer
is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. 

Our founder, sponsor, officers, and directors
may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business
combination and their respective participation in any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in respect of determining
to which such company a particular business combination opportunity should be presented, particularly in the event there is overlap among
the investment mandates of such companies. Additionally, one of our directors, Mr. Stein, has invested in other blank check companies.
We do not believe Mr. Stein s investments would affect our ability to identify and pursue business opportunities or complete
our initial business combination. 

Moreover, because our management team has significant
experience in identifying and executing multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously and we are not limited by industry or geography
in terms of the acquisition opportunities we can pursue, except with respect to our prohibition from seeking target acquisitions in China
and Hong Kong. In addition, our founder, sponsor, officers, and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our
affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying
potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. 

Initial Business Combination 

Nasdaq rules require that we complete one
or more initial business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value of the assets held in the trust
account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our
signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination
as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. 

9 

If our board of directors is not able to independently
determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking
firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we
consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our
initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target
or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects. 

We anticipate structuring our initial business
combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100 of the equity interests
or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction
company owns or acquires less than 100 of such interests or assets of the target business for the post-acquisition company to meet certain
objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if
the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an
interest in the target or assets sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 

Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires
50 or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a
minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination.
For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding
capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100 controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance
of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority
of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target
business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned
or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80 of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than
one target business, the 80 of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat
the target businesses together as the initial business combination for the purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval,
as applicable. 

The net proceeds of this offering and the sale
of the placement units released to us from the trust account upon the closing of our initial business combination may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is
paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration
in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may use the balance of the cash released
to us from the trust account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations
of the post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. In addition, we may be required to obtain additional financing
in connection with the closing of our initial business combination to be used following the closing for general corporate purposes as
described above. 

There is no limitation on our ability to raise
funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our
initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously
with the completion of our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any
third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of our sponsors, officers,
directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. We
may also obtain financing prior to the closing of our initial business combination to fund our working capital needs and transaction costs
in connection with our search for and completion of our initial business combination. 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
will provide that, following this offering and prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will be prohibited from
issuing additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account; or (ii) vote
as a class with our public shares: (a) on any initial business combination, or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation to: (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination from the closing of this
offering, or (y) amend the foregoing provisions, unless (in connection with any such amendment to our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation) we offer our public stockholders the opportunity to redeem their public shares

Item 1A.
Risk Factors 

As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide
the information required by this Item. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Annual Report
are any of the risks described in our final prospectus for our Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC. Any of these factors could
result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently
known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Annual
Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our final prospectus for our Initial Public Offering filed
with the SEC and declared effective by the SEC on November 3, 2021 or as disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the period ended September 30, 2021 filed with the SEC on December 20, 2021. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose
additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

We may not be able to complete an initial business
combination with a U.S. target company since such initial business combination may be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations and
review by a U.S. government entity such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and ultimately prohibited. 

Our sponsor, Liberty Fields LLC, is controlled
by a non-U.S. person and has substantial ties with non-U.S. persons in Malaysia. Our sponsor owns approximately 22.4 of our outstanding
shares. Certain companies requiring federal-issued licenses in the United States, such as broadcasters and airlines, may be subject to
rules or regulations that limit foreign ownership. In addition, CFIUS is an interagency committee authorized to review certain transactions
involving foreign investment in the United States by foreign persons in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national
security of the United States. Therefore, because we may be considered a foreign person under such rules and regulations,
we could be subject to foreign ownership restrictions and/or CFIUS review if our proposed business combination is between us and a U.S.
target company engaged in a regulated industry or which may affect national security. The scope of CFIUS was expanded by the Foreign Investment
Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 FIRRMA to include certain non-passive, non-controlling investments in sensitive
U.S. businesses and certain acquisitions of real estate even with no underlying U.S. business. FIRRMA, and subsequent implementing regulations
that are now in force, also subject certain categories of investments to mandatory filings. Therefore, if our potential initial business
combination with a U.S. target company falls within the scope of foreign ownership restrictions, we may be unable to consummate a business
combination with such target company. In addition, if our potential business combination falls within CFIUS s jurisdiction, we may
be required to make a mandatory filing or determine to submit a voluntary notice to CFIUS, or to proceed with the initial business combination
without notifying CFIUS and risk CFIUS intervention, before or after closing the initial business combination. CFIUS may decide to block
or delay our initial business combination, impose conditions to mitigate national security concerns with respect to such initial business
combination or order us to divest all or a portion of a U.S. business of the combined company if we had proceeded without first obtaining
CFIUS clearance. The foreign ownership limitations, and the potential impact of CFIUS, may limit the attractiveness of a transaction with
us or prevent us from pursuing certain initial business combination opportunities that we believe would otherwise be beneficial to us
and our shareholders. As a result, the pool of potential targets with which we could complete an initial business combination may be limited
and we may be adversely affected in terms of competing with other special purpose acquisition companies which do not have similar foreign
ownership issues. 

Moreover, the process of government review, whether
by CFIUS or otherwise, could be lengthy. Because we have only a limited time to complete our initial business combination (12 months,
or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination) our failure to obtain any required approvals within the
requisite time period may require us to liquidate. If we liquidate, our public shareholders may only receive 10.10 per share initially,
and our warrants would expire worthless. This will also cause you to lose any potential investment opportunity in a target company and
the chance of realizing future gains on your investment through any price appreciation in the combined company. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 

Not applicable.

Item 2. Properties 

Our executive offices are located at 78 SW 7 th 
Street Suite 500 Miami, Florida 33130 and our telephone number is 1-305-809-7217. We have agreed to pay Liberty Fields LLC, a total
of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and the use of this office location is
included in such 10,000 monthly payment. From November 8, 2021 to December 31, 2021 50,000 has been paid. Upon completion
of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. We consider our current office space
adequate for our current operations. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may become involved in legal
proceedings relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Our management believes that there are currently no claims
or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not Applicable.
