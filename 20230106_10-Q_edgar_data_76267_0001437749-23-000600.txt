 (Amounts in thousands, except share (unless otherwise stated), per share and option amounts) 

The fair value of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying value due to their short-term nature. Certain assets and liabilities of the Company are required to be recorded at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis. On a recurring basis, the Company records its marketable securities at fair value using Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. (See Note 3). 

The Company s non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include goodwill and any long-lived assets written down to fair value. To measure fair value of such assets, the Company uses Level 3 inputs consisting of techniques including an income approach and a market approach. The income approach is based on a discounted cash flow analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates, terminal values, growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. With respect to goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value. If, based on that assessment, the Company believes it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value, a goodwill impairment test is performed. There have been no changes in events or circumstances which required impairment charges to be recorded during the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022.

For the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022, the Company s operating lease expenses were and , respectively. Cash payments of , pertaining to operating leases, are reflected in the cash flow statement under cash flows from operating activities.

The Company s weighted average remaining lease term for its operating leases is years. 

In December 2018, the Company entered into a Development Agreement with the City of Newton City ), Kansas and the Board of County Commissioners of Harvey County, Kansas. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company agreed to construct and operate a redundant manufacturing facility of approximately square feet for the design, development and manufacture of advanced composite materials and parts, structures and assemblies for aerospace. The Company further agreed to equip the facility through the purchase of machinery, equipment and furnishings and to create additional new full-time employment of specified levels during a five-year period. In exchange for these agreements, the City and the County agreed to lease to the Company three acres of land at the Newton, Kansas Airport, in addition to the eight acres previously leased to the Company by the City and County. The City and County further agreed to provide financial and other assistance toward the construction of the additional facility as set forth in the Development Agreement. The Company estimates the total cost of the additional facility to be approximately . The expansion construction is complete and is undergoing customer qualifications, which are expected to be completed in the first half of the 2023 calendar year. As of November 27, 2022, the Company had in equipment purchase obligations and of construction-in-progress related to the additional facility. 

Pursuant to the Development Agreement, the City provided a sales tax exemption for materials the Company purchased for the facility, subject to issuance of Industrial Revenue Bonds IRBs ). On June 7, 2022, the City issued IRB Series 2022, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed , pursuant to a Trust Indenture between the City and Security Bank of Kansas City. The Company simultaneously entered into a Bond Purchase Agreement with the City, whereby the Company agreed to buy the IRBs at a purchase price equal to the par amount of the IRBs issued. The Company redeemed the IRBs in August of 2022. Neither the purchase nor redemption of the IRBs had an impact on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

shares of common stock of the Company. Prior to the 2018 Plan, the Company had the 2002 Stock Option Plan (the 2002 Plan which had been approved by the Company s shareholders and provided for the grant of stock options to directors and key employees of the Company. All options granted under the 2018 Plan and 2002 Plan have exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock of the Company at the time of grant which, pursuant to the terms of such Plans, is the reported closing price of the common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date preceding the date the option is granted. Options granted under the Plans become exercisable one year after the date of grant, with an additional exercisable each succeeding anniversary of the date of grant, and expire years after the date of grant. Upon termination of employment or service as a director, all options held by the optionee that have not previously become exercisable shall terminate and all other options held by such optionee may be exercised, to the extent exercisable on the date of such termination, for a limited time after such termination. Any shares of common stock subject to an option under the 2018 Plan, which expire or are terminated unexercised as to such shares, shall again become available for issuance under the 2018 Plan. 

During the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022, the Company granted options under the 2018 Plan to purchase a total of shares of common stock to its directors and certain of its employees. The future compensation expense to be recognized in earnings before income taxes is and will be recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The weighted average fair value of the granted options was per share using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: risk free interest rate of - ; expected volatility factor of - ; expected dividend yield of ; and estimated option term of - years. 

The risk-free interest rates were based on U.S. Treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the estimated terms of the options at the date of the grant. Volatility factors were based on historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The expected dividend yields were based on the regular quarterly cash dividend per share most recently declared by the Company and on the exercise price of the options granted during the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022. The estimated term of the options was based on evaluations of the historical and expected future employee exercise behavior.

As a result, the Company is authorized to purchase up to a total of shares of its common stock, representing approximately of the Company s total outstanding shares as of the close of business on January 2, 2023.

Financial Overview 

The Company's total net sales in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022 were 13.9 million and 40.5 million, respectively, compared to 13.9 million and 41.1 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 28, 2021. 

The Company s gross profit margins, measured as percentages of sales, were 32.0 and 31.1 , respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022 compared to 27.7 and 33.4 , respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 28, 2021. The higher gross profit margin for the 13 weeks ended November 27, 2022 compared to last year s comparable period was primarily due to a favorable sales mix and higher production volumes partially offset by increases in material costs, utility costs, supplier costs, freight costs and other costs due to inflation. The lower gross profit margin for the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022 compared to last year s comparable period was primarily due to a favorable sales mix in the prior year s first quarter and increases in material costs, utility costs, supplier costs, freight costs and other costs due to inflation. 

The Company s net earnings increased 28 in the 13 weeks ended November 27, 2022 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 28, 2021 primarily as a result of a favorable sales mix, higher production levels, recovery of a bad debt and higher interest income partially offset by increases in material costs, utility costs, supplier costs, freight costs and other costs due to inflation. The Company s net earnings decreased 7 in the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022 compared to the 39 weeks ended November 28, 2021 primarily as a result of a less favorable sales mix and increases in material costs, utility costs, supplier costs, freight costs and other costs due to inflation, partially offset by higher interest income compared to last year s comparable period. Additionally, tax expense was negatively impacted by 153,000 in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022 by tax deductions becoming unavailable due to stock options expiring unexercised. 

The Company is experiencing inflation in raw material and other costs. The impact of inflation on the Company s profits has been partially mitigated by the Company s ability to adjust pricing for a portion of its sales to pass the impact of inflation through to its customers. 

17

With the recovery of the aerospace markets, some companies in the aerospace supply chain may not be fully prepared to ramp up their production as quickly as needed, which may create a risk to the Company of not getting enough raw materials on a timely basis to fully support the Company s customers demands. Delays in raw material shipments continue to represent a risk to the Company. 

Programs that the Company supplies into may also be experiencing supply chain issues from other suppliers to the programs. The Company s sales could be impacted by delays in its customers production schedules caused by other suppliers in the chain. 

The tight labor market has created challenges in hiring personnel. Although the Company feels very positive about its workforce, high wage inflation creates challenges in hiring to add to the Company s employee base and has made recent progress in recruiting new employees. Additionally, the Company has a Customer Flexibility Program whereby employees can cross train on different equipment and processes to earn extra pay for attaining the added skills. 

The war in Ukraine has not had a material impact on the Company s results of operations, and it is not expected to have a material impact. The Company does not have any significant customers in Russia or Ukraine. The Company continues to evaluate the impact the war in Ukraine may have on the Company s customers and on the Company s supply chain. 

The Company has a long-term contract pursuant to which one of its customers, which represents a substantial portion of the Company s revenue, places orders. The long-term contract with the customer is requirements based and does not guarantee quantities. An order forecast and pricing were agreed upon in the contract. However, this order forecast is updated periodically during the term of the contract. Purchase orders generally are received by the Company in excess of three months in advance of delivery by the Company to the customer. 

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China and since spread worldwide, including to the United States, posing public health risks that reached pandemic proportions (the COVID-19 Pandemic ). 

The COVID-19 Pandemic and resultant global economic crisis had significant impacts on the Company s results of operations and cash flow for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022 and November 28, 2021, respectively. The COVID-19 Pandemic and crisis had significant impacts on the markets the Company sells into, particularly the commercial and business aircraft markets. As a result, the Company experienced significant reductions in sales and backlog during those periods. The Company continues to experience the impacts related to raw material availability and costs. 

Even after the COVID-19 Pandemic subsided, the Company continues to experience adverse impacts to its business as a result of the potential impact of the economic crisis on the markets the Company serves.

The Company s gross profit in the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022 was lower than its gross profit in the prior year s comparable period, and the gross profit as percentage of sales for the Company s worldwide operations in the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022 decreased to 31.1 from 33.4 in the 39 weeks ended November 28, 2021. The lower gross profit margin for the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022 compared to last year s comparable period was primarily due to a less favorable sales mix, and increases in material costs, utility costs, supplier costs, freight costs and other costs due to inflation. 

19

Cash and Marketable Securities 

Of the 103.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at November 27, 2022, 28.0 million was owned by one of the Company s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. 

The change in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at November 27, 2022 compared to February 27, 2022 was the result of capital expenditures, dividends paid to shareholders and cash used in operating activities and a number of additional factors. The significant change in cash used in operating activities were as follows: 

accounts receivable increased by 7 at November 27, 2022 compared to February 27, 2022 primarily due to timing of sales; 

inventories increased by 46 at November 27, 2022 compared to February 27, 2022 primarily due to timing of raw materials purchases; 

prepaid and other current assets increased by 38 at November 27, 2022 compared to February 27, 2022 primarily due to marketable securities and prepaid insurances; 

accounts payable decreased by 7 at November 27, 2022 compared to February 27, 2022 primarily due to timing of vendor payments; 

accrued liabilities decreased by 15 at November 27, 2022 compared to February 27, 2022 primarily due to decreases in bonus and profit sharing accruals; and 

Income taxes payable decreased by 20 at November 27, 2022 compared to February 27, 2022 due to the recorded tax provision. 

In addition, the Company paid 6.1 million in cash dividends in each of the 39-week periods ended November 27, 2022 and November 28, 2021. 

Working Capital 

The decrease in working capital at November 27, 2022 compared to February 27, 2022 was due principally to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid and other current assets, and decreases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and income taxes payable. 

The Company's current ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 19.4 to 1.0 at November 27, 2022 compared to 20.1 to 1.0 at February 27, 2022. 

Cash Flows 

During the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2022, the Company's net loss, before depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation, amortization of bond premium and changes in operating assets and liabilities, was 2.1 million.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: 

The foregoing Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to sales allowances, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventories, valuation of long-lived assets, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and employee benefit programs. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The Company s critical accounting policies that are important to the Consolidated Financial Statements and that entail, to a significant extent, the use of estimates and assumptions and the application of management s judgment are described in Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 27, 2022. There have been no significant changes to such accounting policies during the 2023 fiscal year third quarter.

Contingencies: 

The Company is subject to a small number of immaterial proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, employment, product and other matters. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. 

Factors That May Affect Future Results . 

Certain portions of this Report which do not relate to historical financial information may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company s expectations or from results which might be projected, forecasted, estimated or budgeted by the Company in forward-looking statements.
