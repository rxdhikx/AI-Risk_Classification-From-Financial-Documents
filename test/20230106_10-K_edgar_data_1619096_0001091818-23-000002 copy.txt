ITEM
1. BUSINESS 

Corporate
Background and General Business Overview 

Summit
Networks Inc. (together with its subsidiary, the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July
8, 2014. Originally, the Company was formed to engage in the development and operation of a business engaged in the distribution of glass
craft products produced in China. On May 8, 2018, we acquired Real Capital Limited, a Hong Kong company Real Capital ),
to seek opportunities in the food and beverage industry. On March 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the
 Real Capital SPA pursuant to which it sold its interests in Real Capital. The closing of the Real Capital SPA occurred
on April 10, 2019. 

On
July 17, 2019, the Company received FINRA approval to effect a 10-for-1 stock dividend to holders of its common stock as of June 1, 2019,
the record date for the dividend. As a result, common stock figures, share capital, additional paid in capital, and earnings per share
information have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock dividend. 

On
May 8, 2020, Sumnet (Canada) Inc. Sumnet (Canada) was incorporated in Canada. Sumnet (Canada) issued all its ordinary
shares to the Company on May 8, 2020 so that Sumnet (Canada) became the wholly owned subsidiary of Company. On July 29, 2020, Smith Barney
Enterprises Limited Smith Barney was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Smith Barney issued all its ordinary
shares to the Company on July 29, 2020 so that Smith Barney became the wholly owned subsidiary of Company. On August 28, 2020, Green
Energy (HK) Limited Green Energy was incorporated in Hong Kong. Green Energy issued all its ordinary shares to Smith
Barney on August 28, 2020 so that Green Energy became the wholly owned subsidiary of Smith Barney. On September 27, 2020, Beijing Asian
League Wins Technology Co., Ltd. Beijing ALW was incorporated in People s Republic of China. Green Energy subscribed
all capital stock of Beijing ALW on September 27, 2020 so that Beijing ALW became the wholly owned subsidiary of Green Energy. 

On
January 20, 2021, Beijing ALW and Green Energy entered into a series of contractual agreements (the VIE Agreement with
Hengshui Jingzhen Environmental Company Limited Hengshui Jingzhen , or the VIE ), whereby Beijing ALW gained
control over Hengshui Jingzhen, a P.R. China company, which provides integrated hazardous waste management services, including collecting,
transferring, disposing, and recycling of hazardous waste, primarily in Hebei, China. On March 29, 2021, the board of directors and a
majority shareholder of the Company approved the termination of the VIE Agreements with Hengshui Jingzhen. On the same date, Beijing
ALW, Hengshui Jingzhen, and Hengshui Jingzhen s shareholders entered into a Termination Agreement (the Termination Agreement to terminate all existing VIE Agreements signed on January 20, 2021. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, all of the rights and obligations
under the existing VIE Agreements were terminated and the Company no longer had control of Hengshui Jingzhen. 

Currently,
we are in the early stage of development of our new business plan which involves acting as an international agent through our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Smith Barney, Green Energy and Beijing ALW, for a Chinese environmental company, Hengshui Jingzhen Environmental Technology
Company Limited of Hebei, China Hengshui ), to market its environmental technologies, equipment and products and to develop
projects utilizing its environmental technologies, equipment and products in worldwide markets. Hengshui provides solutions for the disposal
of hazardous waste, pollution treatment equipment and supplies fossil fuels made from industrial waste. It is a company that focuses
on providing solutions for environmental protection, especially on recycling and exploitation of hazardous waste. It possesses technology
in connection with hazardous waste collection, disposal and utilization, in order to handle hazardous waste more efficiently and regenerate
energy from waste. However, to date, our activities have been limited to capital formation, organization and development of a business
plan. 

- 3 - 

We
are presently evaluating the optimal corporate and legal structures in China necessary to establish our business or to acquire and/or
invest in existing environmental technology businesses. We aim to start marketing the environmental equipment and solutions in 2022 across
the China, Japan, the Southeast Asia and the United States. The services and products that we plan to market include disposal of hazardous
waste, pollution treatment equipment and fossil fuels made from industrial waste. We desire to market Hengshui s products by acquiring
businesses in possession of the waste conversion technology, organizing conferences nationwide with potential enterprise client in need
of waste disposal services, and partnering with local environmental protection ventures to expand Hengshui s outreach to hundreds
of factories across China. However, our plan to operate in the hazardous waste disposal industry may be adversely impacted by the outbreak
of coronavirus, which was first reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and is now continuing to spread throughout
other parts of the world. Although China has made great efforts to contain the spread of the virus and had brought the outbreak under
control, the economy, financial market and businesses in China have been suffering from the pandemic. 

On
January 20, 2021, the Company changed its fiscal year-end from July 31 to September 30.

Background 

Summit
Networks Inc. (together with its subsidiary, the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July
8, 2014. Originally, the Company was formed to engage in the distribution of glass craft products produced in China. On May 8, 2018,
we acquired Real Capital Limited, a Hong Kong company Real Capital ), to seek opportunities in the food and beverage industry.
On March 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Real Capital SPA pursuant to which it sold
its interests in Real Capital. The closing of the Real Capital SPA occurred on April 10, 2019. 

Results
of Operations 

During
the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we generated no revenues. Our operating expenses for the same periods were comprised of general
and administrative expenses of 108,205 and 572,682, respectively, resulting in net loss of 108,205 for the year ended September 30,
2022 compared to a net loss of 454,074 for the year ended September 30, 2021. Our general and administrative expenses consisted of
mainly professional fees for the year ended September 30, 2021, and consisted of mainly management fees, chief executive fees and director
fees for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease of general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the decrease of management
fees, chief executive fees and director fees. 

Our
total assets as of September 30, 2022 were 8,829. 

As
of September 30, 2022, the Company had 62,049,990 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 

As
of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there are a total of 579,000 and 579,000 in amounts respectively, due to related parties and shareholders
were interest free, unsecured and payable on demand. 

Even
if we are able to obtain sufficient number of service agreements at the end of the twelve months period, there is no guarantee
that we will be able to attract and more importantly, retain enough customers to cover our expenditures. If we are unable to generate
a significant amount of revenue, then it would materially affect our financial condition. 

Based
on our current operating plan, we may need to obtain additional financing to operate our business for the next twelve months. Additional
financing, whether through public or private equity or debt financing, or if available, may be on terms unacceptable to us. 

- 6 - 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
for the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had a negative cash flow of 72,049 and 211,725, respectively. The Company s
principal sources and uses of funds were as follows: 

For
the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company used 72,049 in cash for operations as compared to 385,189 for the year ended September
30, 2021, respectively. Such decrease was primarily due to lower net loss in year ended September 30, 2022. The net cash provided
by the financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022 was nil, as compared to 179,000 from related parties for the year
ended September 30, 2021. Such decrease was a result of fewer advances from the related parties. 

The
Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the
settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company s liquidity and capital needs relate primarily
to working capital and other general corporate requirements. The Company s operations do not currently provide cash flow. To date,
the Company has funded its operations by advances from related parties. The business will require significant amounts of capital in the
near term to sustain operations and make the investments it needs to continue operations and execute its longer-term business plan. As
of September 30, 2022, we had 8,829 in cash and the outstanding liabilities were 771,167. As of September 30, 2021 we had cash of 80,878
and there were outstanding liabilities of 738,333. The working capital deficits were 762,338 and 654,133, for September 30, 2022 and
2021, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as discussed in the footnotes
to our financial statements. The Company will be unable to conduct its planned operations unless we obtain financing in the near term
to meet the needs of our on-going operations, generate future revenue from operations and/or obtain the necessary financing to meet our
obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. In order to implement its business
plan, management s plan includes raising capital by equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances
that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. If we issue equity or equity equivalents to raise additional funds,
our existing stockholders will experience substantial dilution and the new holders of securities may have rights, preferences and privileges
senior to those of our existing stockholders. Management also cannot provide any assurance that unforeseen circumstances will not increase
the need for the Company to raise additional capital on an immediate basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue
to raise funds if at all, or on terms acceptable to the Company in which case the Company may be unable to continue its operations or
to meet its obligations. If adequate capital is not available when needed, we will be required to significantly modify our business model
or cease operations. 

On
March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containments
and mitigation measures worldwide. The Company is monitoring this closely, and although operations have not been materially affected
by the coronavirus outbreak to date, the ultimate severity of the outbreak is uncertain. Operations of the Company are ongoing. Further
the uncertain nature of the spread of COVID-19 globally may impact our business operations due to the quarantine of employees, customers,
and third-party service providers. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arran g ements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that is material to investors.

accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern 

As
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company had limited operations during the period from July 8, 2014 (date of inception)
to September 30, 2022 resulting in accumulated deficit of 1,218,255 and has not generated any revenue. There is no guarantee that Company
will generate revenue and net income in the future. At September 30, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficiency of 762,338.
The cash used in operating activities were 72,049. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the accompanying
financial statements. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

NOL period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

None. 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

At
the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the
participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of
the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e)
under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer
and the Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that: (i)
information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and
(ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due primarily to a material weakness in the segregation of duties in the Company s internal
control of financial reporting as discussed below. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (including its consolidated
subsidiaries) and all related information appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our internal control over financial reporting
is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Management
conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered
by this report, based on the criteria in a framework developed by the Company s management pursuant to and in compliance with the
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO)
of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness
of controls, walkthroughs of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management
has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, because management identified a material weakness
in the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to the segregation of duties as described below. 

While
the Company does adhere to internal controls and processes that were designed and implemented based on the COSO report, it is difficult
with a very limited staff to maintain appropriate segregation of duties in the initiating and recording of transactions, thereby creating
a segregation of duties weakness. Due to: (i) the significance of segregation of duties to the preparation of reliable financial statements;
(ii) the significance of potential misstatement that could have resulted due to the deficient controls; and (iii) the absence of sufficient
other mitigating controls, we determined that this control deficiency resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement
or lack of disclosure within the annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives . 

Management
has evaluated, and continues to evaluate, avenues for mitigating our internal controls weaknesses, but mitigating controls to completely
mitigate internal control weaknesses have been deemed to be impractical and prohibitively costly, due to the size of our organization
at the current time. Management expects to continue to use reasonable care in following and seeking improvements to effective internal
control processes that have been and continue to be in use at the Company.

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred prior to the Company s most recent
financial quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting.

We
do not have any independent directors and we are not required to maintain a majority of independent directors under the rules that apply
to companies whose shares are traded on OTC Markets. 

- 21 - 

The
Board and Committees 

Our
Board of Directors at this time does not maintain a separate audit, nominating or compensation committee. Functions customarily performed
by such committees are performed by the Board as a whole. We are an early stage company with very limited operations, therefore our Board
of Directors does not deem it necessary to have more than one director or a nominating or compensation committee. We have not paid any
compensation to any officer or director. Decisions relating to director nominations or compensation can be made on a case by case basis
by the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors would consider any shareholder nominee at such time as it is made. Our Board of Directors
does not believe that a defined policy with regard to the consideration of candidates recommended by stockholders is necessary at this
time because it believes that, given the limited scope of our operations, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations are at a more advanced level. There are no specific, minimum qualifications that the Board believes
must be met by a candidate recommended by the Board of Directors. We do not pay any fee to any third party or parties to identify or
evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential nominees. 

We
have not adopted practices or polices regarding employee, officer and director hedging in accordance with Item 407(i) of Regulation S-K. 

Legal
Proceedings 

To
the knowledge of our management, there are no material proceedings to which any of our directors, officers or affiliates are a party
adverse to our Company. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
intend at some point to adopt a code of ethics that applies to our officers, directors and employees. We will file copies of our code
of ethics in a current report on Form 8-K. You will be able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC s
website at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the code of ethics will be provided without charge upon request to us. We intend to disclose
any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our code of ethics in a current report on Form 8-K. 

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

There
are no current employment agreements between us and our directors and officers. We have never paid any compensation to any of our executive
officers or directors. Our current officers have agreed to work with no remuneration until such time as we receive sufficient revenues
necessary to provide management salaries. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate when sufficient revenues will occur that will allow
us to begin paying this compensation, or what the amount of the compensation will be. The Company currently has no annuity, pension or
retirement benefits proposed to be paid to our officers, directors or employees.
