       "'. risk factors our operations and financial results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial conditions, and the trading price of our common stock. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. you should consider these risks and uncertainties carefully, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form -k. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. you should not interpret our disclosure of any of the following risks to imply that such risks have not already materialized. summary risk factors we may be unable for many reasons, including those that are beyond our control, to implement our business strategy successfully. below is a summary of material factors that make an investment in our shares of common stock speculative or risky. importantly, this summary does not address all of the risks and uncertainties that we face. additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties summarized in this risk factor summary, as well as other risks and uncertainties that we face, immediately follows this risk factor summary. the below risk factor summary is qualified in its entirety by that more complete discussion of such risks and uncertainties. we have a limited operating history and only recently launched our commercial products, which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for our future viability and predict our future performance. we have limited experience marketing and selling our products. we are highly dependent on a limited number of product offerings. our revenue has been primarily generated from sales of our core aurora and northern light systems, which require a substantial sales cycle and are prone to quarterly fluctuations in revenue. our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers. we rely on single source suppliers and, in some cases, sole source suppliers, for certain components and materials used in our systems and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. on august , , we and cytek (wuxi) biosciences co., ltd, our china subsidiary (the subsidiary ), entered into a supply agreement (the coherent agreement with coherent na, inc. coherent ). pursuant to the coherent agreement, coherent has agreed to sell and supply to us and the subsidiary, on a non-exclusive basis, laser products manufactured by coherent. other than the coherent agreement, we do not currently have long-term supply contracts with our sole and single source suppliers of key components. our results of operations will be harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products and manage our inventory. our business is dependent on adoption of our products by academic and government institutions, clinical research organizations, pharmaceutical companies and clinical laboratories for their research and development activities focused on cell analysis. if academic and government institutions, clinical research organizations, pharmaceutical companies and clinical laboratories are unwilling to adopt our products, it will negatively affect our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. if we are unable to manufacture our products in high-quality commercial quantities successfully and consistently to meet demand, our growth will be limited. our future success is dependent upon our ability to increase penetration in our existing markets and expand into adjacent markets. if we are unable to successfully expand our commercial operations, including hiring additional qualified sales representatives, technical applications specialists and customer support staff, our business may be adversely affected. we and our suppliers are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. our products may become subject to more onerous regulation by the fda or other regulatory agencies in the future, which could increase our costs and delay or prevent sales of our products or commercialization of new products and product enhancements. concentration of ownership of our common stock among our executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their respective affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions. based on shares outstanding as of december , , our executive officers, directors, holders of or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates, in the aggregate, own approximately . of our common stock. these stockholders, acting together, will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger or other significant corporate transaction. if we are unable to obtain and maintain patent or other intellectual property protection for any of our current or future products, or if the scope of the patent and other intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our current or future products may be harmed. our business currently depends significantly on research and development spending by academic institutions and government-owned institutions, a reduction in which could limit demand for our solutions and adversely affect our business and operating results. international operations and expansion of our international business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the united states. the market for cell analysis technologies and life sciences tools, including flow cytometry, is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. if we are unable to successfully develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change, respond to introductions of new products by competitors, make strategic and operational decisions to prioritize certain markets, technology offerings or partnerships, and develop and capitalize on markets, technologies or partnerships, our business could suffer. if our products do not perform as expected, our operating results, reputation and business will suffer. we may acquire other businesses or form other joint ventures or make investments in other companies or technologies that could negatively affect our operating results, dilute our stockholders ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense. if we are unable to expand or leverage the number of peer-reviewed articles published using data generated by our products or otherwise increase brand awareness, the demand for our products and our business may be adversely affected. we have increased the size of our organization and expect to further increase it in the future, and we may experience difficulties in managing our growth. if we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be harmed. we rely on distributors for sales of our products in certain geographies outside of the united states. if we are unable to secure additional distributors or maintain good relationships with our existing distributors, or if such distributors do not perform adequately or effectively, our business could suffer. we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. if we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations. our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide. we may need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations, develop our products and/or expand our operations. failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, contracts, self-regulatory schemes, standards, and other obligations related to data privacy and security (including security incidents) could harm our business. compliance or the actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could increase the costs of our products and services, limit their use or adoption, and otherwise negatively affect our operating results and business. risks related to our business and strategy we have a limited operating history and only recently launched our commercial products, which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for our future viability and predict our future performance. we have limited experience marketing and selling our products. we have a limited operating history and may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown obstacles. we launched our first core commercial product, the aurora system, in june . our limited commercial and operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance. although we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods, any assessment of our future revenue, profitability or prediction about our future success or viability is subject to significant uncertainty. we have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies with limited operating histories in emerging and rapidly changing industries, including scaling up our infrastructure and headcount. if our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. we are highly dependent on a limited number of product offerings. our revenue has been primarily generated from sale of our core aurora and northern lights systems, which require a substantial sales cycle and are prone to quarterly fluctuations in revenue. our aurora system was commercially launched in june , our northern lights system was commercially launched in october and our aurora cs was first commercially shipped in june . sales of the aurora, northern lights and aurora cs systems together accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue for the periods presented. we expect that, for at least the foreseeable future, sales of our aurora, northern lights and aurora cs systems will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue. the sales cycle for our flow cytometer instruments is slow and can take up to six months or longer to complete. as a result of this lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle, we will be prone to quarterly fluctuations in our revenue as sales of the aurora and northern lights systems are expected to continue to comprise a significant component of our revenue. additionally, we experience seasonality in our business, with revenue in the fourth quarter typically being higher as a result of higher sales volume. quarterly fluctuations may make it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. consequently, comparisons of our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. as a result of variability and unpredictability, we may also fail to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. if our revenue or operating results fall short of the expectations of analysts or investors or any guidance we may provide, or if the guidance we provide falls short of the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met or exceeded any previously publicly stated guidance we may have provided. we currently rely on single source suppliers and, in some cases, sole source suppliers, for certain components and materials used in our systems and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have sourced and will continue to source certain components of the aurora, northern lights and aurora cs systems from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, sole source suppliers. key components in our products that are supplied by sole or single source suppliers include certain lasers, semiconductors and mechanical components that are used in our optical, electrical and fluidic subassemblies. on august , , we and our china subsidiary entered into the coherent agreement with coherent. pursuant to the coherent agreement, coherent has agreed to sell and supply to us and the subsidiary, on a non-exclusive basis, laser products manufactured by coherent. we and the subsidiary provide coherent with rolling forecasts of our and the subsidiary s anticipated orders, which are non-binding. purchase orders submitted by us and the subsidiary pursuant to the terms of the coherent agreement will be deemed accepted upon written acknowledgement of acceptance by coherent. other than the coherent agreement, we do not currently have long-term supply contracts with our sole and single source suppliers of key components. additionally, we believe we are not a major customer to most of our suppliers. our suppliers may therefore give other customers needs higher priority than ours, and we may not be able to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms. while we are in the process of qualifying additional sources of supply, qualifications can take to months and, in some cases, longer. if we were to lose one or more of our sole or single source suppliers, it would take significant time and effort to qualify alternative suppliers, if available. moreover, in the event that we transition to a new supplier, particularly from any of our single source suppliers, doing so could be time-consuming and expensive, may result in interruptions in our ability to supply our products to the market and could affect the performance of our products, resulting in increased costs and negative customer perception. although we believe that we have stable relationships with our existing suppliers, we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure a stable supply of components materials going forward. in the event that any adverse developments occur with our suppliers, in particular for those products that are sole-sourced, or if any of our suppliers modifies any of the components they supply to us, our ability to supply our products may be temporarily or permanently interrupted. obtaining substitute components could be difficult, time and resource-consuming and costly. also, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure a supply of alternative components at reasonable prices without experiencing interruptions in our business operations. in addition, quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders related to the covid- pandemic or other infectious disease outbreaks, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur, could impact the suppliers upon which we rely, or the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt the supply chain for our products. in addition, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have obtained and will be able to obtain or maintain all licenses, permits and approvals necessary for their operations or comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and failure to do so by them may lead to interruption in their business operations, which in turn may result in shortages of components supplied to us. supply interruptions have in the past arisen and could arise in the future from effects of the covid- pandemic, shortages of raw materials, labor disputes or weather conditions affecting products or shipments, transportation disruptions, adjustments to our inventory levels or other factors within and beyond our control, and such supply interruption risk is increased by the limited number of suppliers for certain of the components we use in our products. our failure to maintain a continued supply of components that meets our quality control requirements for any reason, including changes to or termination of our agreements with key suppliers, or to enter into new agreements with other suppliers, particularly in the case of single or sole source suppliers, could result in the loss of access to important components and materials used in our products and impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products. any delay or interruption in the supply of our materials could delay or suspend sales of our products and increase the costs of manufacturing our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our results of operations will be harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products and manage our inventory. to ensure adequate supply of our instruments and other products, we must forecast the inventory needs of our current and prospective customers, and manufacture our products based on our estimates of future demand. our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our failure to accurately manage our expansion strategy, product introductions by competitors, an increase or decrease in customer demand for our products or for products of our competitors, our failure to accurately forecast market acceptance of new products, changes in general market conditions, including as a result of the covid- pandemic, seasonal demands, regulatory matters, inflation or weakening of general economic conditions. we seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory of our instruments and other products to protect ourselves from supply interruptions. we rely in part on our support organizations and distributors to supply forecasts of anticipated product orders in their respective territories. if we fail to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, our inventory forecasts may be inaccurate, resulting in shortages or excesses of inventory. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs, which would cause our gross margin to be adversely affected and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. conversely, if we underestimate customer demand for our products, we may not be able to deliver products in a timely manner or at all, and this could result in reduced revenue and damage to our reputation and customer relationships. in addition, if we experience a significant increase in demand, we may not have adequate manufacturing capacity to meet such demand, and additional supplies may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to meet our increased requirements, all of which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. if we are unable to meet customer demand, we could lose our existing customers or lose our ability to acquire new customers, which would also negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have limited experience manufacturing our products and if we are unable to manufacture our products in high-quality commercial quantities successfully and consistently to meet demand, our growth will be limited. we have limited experience manufacturing our products. we currently manufacture our instruments and reagents at our manufacturing facilities in fremont, california, and wuxi, china, and reagents at our facility in san diego, california. to manufacture our products in the quantities that we believe will be required to meet the currently anticipated market demand beyond the next several years, we will need to increase manufacturing capacity, which will involve significant challenges and may require additional quality controls and regulatory approvals. we may not successfully complete any required increase to existing manufacturing capacity in a timely manner, or at all. if there is a disruption to our manufacturing operations, we will have no other means of producing our products until we resolve such issues with our manufacturing facilities, develop alternative manufacturing facilities, or contract with third-party manufacturers capable of producing our products. additionally, any damage to or destruction of our manufacturing facilities or equipment may significantly impair our ability to manufacture products on a timely basis. there may also be unforeseen occurrences that increase our costs, such as increased prices of the components of our products, changes to labor costs or less favorable terms with third-party suppliers. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter such problems in the future. if we are unable to manufacture products consistently and in sufficient quantities to meet anticipated customer demand, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be harmed. as we continue to scale the commercial production of our products and increase our manufacturing capacity, we may encounter quality issues that could result in product defects, errors or recalls. manufacturing delays related to quality control could negatively impact our ability to bring our products to market, harm our reputation and decrease our revenue. any defects, errors or recalls could be expensive and generate negative publicity, which could impair our ability to market or sell our products, and adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, the introduction of new products may require the development of new manufacturing sites, processes or procedures as well as new suppliers. developing new processes and negotiating supply agreements can be very time consuming, and any unexpected difficulty in doing so could delay the introduction of a product. our future success is dependent upon our ability to increase penetration in our existing markets and expand into adjacent markets. our customer base includes academic and government institutions, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, clinical research organizations and clinical laboratories focused on cell analysis. approximately and of our revenue came from sales to academic and government-owned institutions and and of our revenue came from sales to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, distributors and cros in the year ended december , and , respectively. our success will depend upon our ability to increase our market penetration. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to further penetrate our existing markets or that these markets will be able to sustain our current and future product and service offerings. any failure to increase penetration in our existing markets would adversely affect our ability to improve our operating results. our success will also depend on our ability to further expand into adjacent markets, such as immunotherapy, immuno-oncology, bio-processing, infectious diseases and immune-deficiencies, as well as areas outside of healthcare, such as marine biology and alternative biofuels and other environmental fields. for example, in the united states, our products are currently labeled and promoted, and are, and in the near-future are expected to continue to be, sold primarily to academic and research institutions and biopharmaceutical companies as research use only products for non-diagnostic and non-clinical purposes, and are not currently designed, or intended to be used, for clinical diagnostic tests. we plan to continue generating supporting publications and data, as well as pursue any required regulatory approvals for clinical use for our products in the united states. our ability to penetrate the clinical markets in the united states will depend in part on our ability to receive (k) clearance, de novo classification, or approval of a pre-market approval application from the fda. our failure to further expand in adjacent markets and attract new customers could adversely affect our ability to improve our operating results. our business is dependent on adoption of our products by academic and government institutions, clinical research organizations, pharmaceutical companies and clinical laboratories for their research and development activities focused on cell analysis. if academic and government institutions, clinical research organizations, pharmaceutical companies and clinical laboratories are unwilling to change current practices to adopt our products, it will negatively affect our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. our primary strategy to grow our revenue is to take a stepwise approach to market our products across key stakeholders in flow cytometry and cell analysis, such as academic and government institutions, clinical research organizations, pharmaceutical companies and clinical laboratories. while the number of customers using our products has increased in recent years, many academic and government institutions, clinical research organizations, pharmaceutical companies and clinical laboratories have not yet adopted our products, and such institutions and companies may choose not to adopt our products for a number of reasons, including: inadequate recruiting or training of talented sales force in existing and new markets to facilitate outreach and further adoption and awareness of our products; lack of experience with our products for cell analysis; perceived inadequacy of evidence supporting benefits or cost-effectiveness of our products over existing alternatives; liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and processes; the training required to use new products; a decrease or delay in the research and development activities using our products as a result of the covid- pandemic; competing products and alternatives; and introduction of other novel alternative products for cell analysis. we believe that educating notable industry kols, representatives of academic and government institutions, clinical research organizations, pharmaceutical companies and clinical laboratories, about the merits and benefits of our products for flow cytometry and cell analysis is one of key elements of increasing the adoption of our products. if these institutions and companies do not adopt our products for any reason, including those listed above, our ability to execute our growth strategy will be impaired, and it will negatively affect our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. our business currently depends significantly on research and development spending by academic and government-owned institutions, a reduction in which could limit demand for our solutions and adversely affect our business and operating results. approximately and of our revenue came from sales to academic and government-owned institutions in the year ended december , and , respectively. much of their funding was, in turn, provided by various state, federal and foreign government agencies. in the near term, we expect that a large portion of our revenue will continue to be derived from sales to academic and government-owned institutions. as a result, the demand for our solutions may depend upon the research and development budgets of these customers, which are impacted by factors beyond our control, such as: decreases in government funding of research and development; changes to programs that provide funding to research laboratories, hospitals and related institutions, including changes in the amount of funds allocated to different areas of research or changes that have the effect of increasing the length of the funding process; macroeconomic conditions and the political climate; scientists and customers opinions of the utility of new products or services; changes in the regulatory environment; differences in budgetary cycles; competitor product offerings or pricing; market-driven pressures to consolidate operations and reduce costs; and market acceptance of relatively new technologies, such as ours. in addition, various state, federal and foreign agencies that provide grants and other funding may be subject to stringent budgetary constraints that could result in spending reductions, reduced grant making, reduced allocations or budget cutbacks, including as a result of negative or worsening conditions in the general economy, which could jeopardize the ability of these customers, or the customers to whom they provide funding, to purchase our solutions. for example, congressional appropriations to the national institutes of health (the nih have generally increased year-over-year in recent years, but the nih also experiences occasional year-over-year decreases in appropriations. there is no guarantee that nih appropriations will not decrease or halt in the future. a decrease in the amount or halt of, or delay in the approval of, appropriations to nih or other similar united states or foreign organizations, such as the medical research council in the united kingdom, could result in fewer grants benefiting life sciences research. these reductions or delays could also result in a decrease in the aggregate amount of grants awarded for life sciences research or the redirection of existing funding to other projects or priorities, any of which in turn could cause our customers and potential customers to reduce or delay purchases of our solutions. our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to any such reductions and delays. any decrease in our customers budgets or expenditures, or in the size, scope or frequency of their capital or operating expenditures, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. we rely on distributors for sales of our products in certain geographies outside of the united states. if we are unable to secure additional distributors or maintain good relationships with our existing distributors, or if such distributors do not perform adequately or effectively, our business could suffer. in addition to selling our products through our direct sales force and support organizations in north america, europe, china, and several other countries in the asia-pacific region, we sell our products through third-party distributors or sales agents in certain countries in europe, latin america, the middle east and the asia-pacific region. if current or future distributors do not perform adequately or effectively or fail to obtain or maintain any required regulatory approvals, we may not realize long-term international revenue growth and our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed. we have limited control over our distributors, which may not commit the necessary resources to market our products to the level of our expectations. we intend to continue to grow our business internationally and to do so we may choose to partner with additional distributors to maximize the commercial opportunity for our products. there is no guarantee that we will be successful in attracting or retaining desirable sales and distribution partners or that we will be able to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms, which could affect our ability to expand into or further penetrate certain geographies and adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. international operations and expansion of our international business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the united states. we currently have significant international operations and our business strategy incorporates further international expansion. we currently maintain relationships with distributors and suppliers outside of the united states and may in the future enter into new distributor and supplier relationships outside of the united states. in addition, we currently have manufacturing operations in both the united states and china. doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including: multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as privacy regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, tariffs, economic sanctions and embargoes, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses; failure by us or our distributors to obtain approvals to conduct our business in various countries; differing intellectual property rights; complexities and difficulties in obtaining intellectual property protection, enforcing our intellectual property and defending against third party intellectual property claims; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; logistics and regulations associated with shipping systems and parts and components for our products, as well as transportation delays; travel restrictions that limit the ability of marketing, presales, sales, services and support teams to service customers, including those resulting from the covid- pandemic; financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; international trade disputes that could result in tariffs and other protective measures; natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest such as the ongoing war in ukraine, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors activities that may fall within the purview of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the fcpa ), its books and records provisions, or its anti-bribery provisions. any of these factors could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. in addition, certain international markets are subject to significant political and economic uncertainty, including, for example, the effect of the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union. significant political and economic developments in international markets in which we currently or intend to operate, or the perception that any of them could occur, creates further challenges for operating in these markets in addition to creating instability in global economic conditions. the market for cell analysis technologies and life sciences tools, including flow cytometry, is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue, or achieve and sustain profitability. we face significant competition in the cell analysis and life sciences tools markets. we currently compete with both established and early stage life sciences and in vitro diagnostics ivd companies that design, manufacture and market flow cytometry instruments, consumables and software for cell analysis and/or provide services related to the same. an increasing number of applications for cell analysis, and more particularly flow cytometry, is leading to more companies offering competitive products and services. our competitors include agilent technologies, beckman coulter (danaher corporation), becton, dickinson and company bd ), bio-rad laboratories, standard biotools inc., miltenyi biotec, sony biotechnology (sony corporation), and thermo fisher scientific. our target customers may also elect to develop their workflows using other technologies rather than implementing our platform or existing customers may decide to stop using our platform. in addition, there are many large, established companies in the life sciences tools market that could develop instruments or other products that will compete with us in the future. these large, established companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, including larger research and development, quality and regulatory staff or more established marketing and sales forces. our competitors and potential competitors may enjoy a number of competitive advantages over us, including: longer operating histories; larger customer bases; greater brand recognition and market penetration; greater financial resources and capabilities; greater technological and research and development resources; larger intellectual property portfolios; better system reliability and robustness; greater selling and marketing capabilities; and better established, larger scale and lower cost manufacturing capabilities. in addition, competitors may be acquired by, receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger, well-established and well-financed companies. our competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer requirements, devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we can, secure key components from suppliers on more favorable terms, adopt more aggressive pricing policies or sell their products or offer services competitive with our products at prices and margins designed to win significant levels of market share. we may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations. if we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market adoption and sales of our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers. our current products include instruments, consumables and services to advance high-content and high-sensitivity cell analysis by utilizing our full spectrum profiling fsp technology. we cannot assure you that the market for our current products will continue to generate significant or consistent demand. demand for our current products could be significantly diminished by competitive technologies or products that replace them or render them obsolete or less desirable. accordingly, we must continue to invest in research and development to develop competitive products and enabling services. our future success depends on our ability to anticipate our customers needs and develop new products and enhance current products and services to address those needs. introduction of new products and product enhancements will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and coordinate our efforts with those of our suppliers to achieve the desired level of production. if we fail to transfer production processes effectively, develop product enhancements or introduce new products or enabling services in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of our customers, or effectively coordinate with our suppliers, our net sales may be reduced and our business would be harmed. the commercial success of all of our products and services will depend upon their acceptance by the life sciences and biopharmaceutical industries. some of the products and services that we are developing are based upon new technologies or approaches. as a result, there can be no assurance that these new products and services, even if successfully developed and introduced, will be accepted by customers. if customers do not adopt our new products, services and technologies, our results of operations may suffer and, as a result, the market price of our common stock may decline. if we are unable to successfully develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change, respond to introductions of new products by competitors, make strategic and operational decisions to prioritize certain markets, technology offerings or partnerships, and develop and capitalize on markets, technologies or partnerships, our business could suffer. we currently sell our products primarily in the cell analysis market, which is characterized by significant enhancements and evolving industry and regulatory standards. as a result, our customers needs are rapidly evolving. if we do not appropriately innovate and offer our customers comprehensive solutions and otherwise invest in new technologies, our offerings may become less desirable in the markets we serve, and our customers could move to new technologies offered by our competitors or make products themselves. without the timely introduction of new instruments, consumables, software, services and enhancements, our offerings may become less competitive over time, in which case our competitive position and operating results could suffer. accordingly, we focus significant efforts and resources on the development and identification of new products and applications to further drive adoption of our platform. to the extent we fail to timely introduce new and innovative products, offer enhancements to our existing products, adequately predict our customers needs or fail to obtain desired levels of market acceptance, our business may suffer and our operating results could be adversely affected. we believe our products have potential applications across a wide range of markets and we have targeted certain markets in which we believe our technology has significant advantages, or for which we believe we have a higher probability of success or revenue opportunity. for example, we are committed to developing our platform s applications within the clinical market, and in particular, within disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring. we seek to maintain a process of prioritization and resource allocation among our programs to maintain a balance between advancing near-term opportunities and exploring additional markets and use cases for our technology. however, due to the significant resources required for the development of products or services for new markets, we must make decisions on which markets to pursue and the amount of resources to allocate to each. our decisions concerning the allocation of research, development, collaboration, management and financial resources toward particular markets, products or services may not lead to the development of any viable products or services and may divert resources away from better opportunities. similarly, our potential decisions to delay, terminate or collaborate with third parties in respect of certain markets may subsequently also prove to be suboptimal and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities. in particular, if we are unable to accelerate adoption of our fsp solutions, it could slow or stop our business growth and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. new product development involves a lengthy and complex process and we may be unable to develop or commercialize products on a timely basis, or at all. products from our research and development programs will take time and considerable resources to develop, and may include improvements or changes to our current products, and we may not be able to complete development and commercialization of new or enhanced products on a timely basis, or at all. there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will produce commercially viable products and solutions and before we can commercialize any new products, we will need to expend significant funds to, for example: conduct substantial research and development; obtain necessary regulatory approval; further develop and scale our laboratory, engineering and manufacturing processes to accommodate different products; source and enter into agreements with new suppliers; and further develop and scale our infrastructure. our product development processes involve a high degree of risk, and these efforts may be delayed or fail for many reasons, including failure of the product to perform as expected and failure to reliably demonstrate the advantages of the product. even if we are successful in developing new products, it will require us to make significant additional investments in marketing and selling resources to commercialize any such products. as a result, we may be unsuccessful in commercializing new products that we develop, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. our fsp systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers, which could increase our costs and reduce our net sales. if our products do not perform as expected or the reliability of the technology on which our products and services are based is questioned, our operating results, reputation and business will suffer. our success depends on our ability to provide reliable, high quality products that enable high-content and high-sensitivity cell analysis through flexible, efficient and cost-effective solutions. our fsp systems are complex in design and involve a highly complex and precise manufacturing process. as a result of the technological complexity of our systems, changes in our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in an adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability. to the extent that we do not achieve and maintain our projected yields or product reliability, our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected. we provide warranties on a majority of our product sales, and reserves for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale. the determination of such reserves requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty. we typically establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line. if actual repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully installed and operated. in addition, some of our products include components from other vendors, which may contain defects. as a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. if we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things: loss of customers or orders; increased costs of warranty expenses; damage to our brand reputation; failure to attract new customers; diversion of development, engineering and manufacturing resources; regulatory actions by governmental authorities; and legal actions by our customers. we believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors. our reputation and the public image of our products, services and technologies may be impaired if our products or services fail to perform as expected. if our products do not perform, or are perceived to not have performed, as expected or favorably in comparison to competitive products, our operating results, reputation, and business will suffer, and we may also be subject to legal claims arising from product limitations, errors, or inaccuracies. any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. although our products are tested prior to shipment, defects or errors could nonetheless occur. our operating results depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. a failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. in each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. we provide a one-year assurance-type warranty on our instruments. existing and future warranties place us at the risk of incurring future repair and/or replacement costs. at the time revenue is recognized, we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical data and trends of product reliability and costs of repairing and replacing defective products. we exercise judgment in estimating the expected product warranty costs, using data such as the actual and projected product failure rates, estimated repair costs, freight, material, labor and overhead costs. while we believe that historical experience provides a reliable basis for estimating such warranty cost, unforeseen quality issues or component failure rates could result in future costs in excess of such estimates, or alternatively, improved quality and reliability in our products and consumables could result in actual expenses that are below those currently estimated. as of december , , we had accrued approximately . million in expenses relating to product warranty accruals. substantial amounts of warranty claims could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. even after any underlying concerns or problems are resolved, any lingering concerns in our target markets regarding our technology or any manufacturing defects or performance errors in our products or services could continue to result in lost revenue, delayed market acceptance, damage to our reputation and claims against us. we may acquire other businesses or form other joint ventures or make investments in other companies or technologies that could negatively affect our operating results, dilute our stockholders ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense from time to time, we may pursue acquisitions of businesses and assets. for example, in february , we entered into an asset purchase agreement with luminex corporation luminex to acquire certain assets related to the flow cytometry and imaging fci business unit of luminex (the fci acquisition ). we may choose to further expand our business by acquiring additional businesses or assets in the future. we also may pursue strategic alliances and additional joint ventures that leverage products and industry experience to expand our offerings or distribution. we have limited experience with acquiring other companies and forming strategic partnerships. we may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. we may not be able to integrate acquisitions, including the recent fci acquisition, successfully into our existing business, and in certain cases we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. any future acquisitions also could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or future write-offs of intangible assets or goodwill, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, any pursuit of an acquisition and any potential integration of an acquired company also may disrupt ongoing operations and divert management attention and resources that we would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. we may experience losses related to investments in other companies, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance or joint venture. shipping is a critical part of our business and any changes in our shipping arrangements or damages or losses sustained during shipping could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. we currently rely on third-party vendors for our shipping. if we are not able to negotiate acceptable pricing and other terms with these entities or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and our customers experience. additionally, our manufacturing operations in fremont and san diego, california, and wuxi, china require global shipping services which are subject to certain factors outside of our control, such as increased costs due to fuel surcharges or otherwise, delays passing through customs and disruptions to global shipping routes. we experienced shipping delays and difficulties due to the covid- pandemic and may again experience such delays or difficulties due to future pandemics, other infectious disease outbreaks or natural disasters. moreover, there is no guarantee that our systems will not become damaged or lost in transit, and we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, delivery difficulties. if a system is damaged in transit, it may result in a substantial delay in the fulfillment of the customer s order, and depending on the type and extent of the damage and whether the incident is covered by insurance, it may result in customer dissatisfaction and a substantial financial loss for us. if our products are not delivered in a timely fashion or are lost during the delivery process, our customers could also become dissatisfied and cease using our products or services, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. additionally, delays in shipping could have an adverse impact on our ability to recognize revenue in a timely manner, which could have an adverse impact on our quarterly results of operations. if we are unable to successfully expand our commercial operations, including hiring additional qualified sales representatives, technical applications specialists and customer support staff, our business may be adversely affected. our future sales will depend, in large part, on our ability to develop and substantially expand our sales infrastructure, particularly as we enter into new markets, rollout new solutions and applications and manage inbound interest from new customers. we distribute our products through our direct sales force and support organizations located in north america, europe, china, and several countries in the asia-pacific region, and through distributors or sales agents in several countries in europe, latin america, the middle east and the asia-pacific region. our sales and marketing efforts are targeted at academic and governmental institutions, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, clinical research organizations and clinical laboratories focused on cell analysis. to continue driving adoption of our solutions and to support our global brand, we will need to further expand our sales infrastructure by hiring additional, highly qualified and reputable sales representatives, technical applications specialists and customer support staff, in addition to increasing advertising efforts. identifying and recruiting qualified personnel with sufficient industry experience and training them requires significant time, expense and attention. we have limited experience in training our personnel to successfully market and sell our products. if we provide inadequate training, fail to increase our sales and marketing capabilities or fail to develop broad brand awareness in a cost-effective manner, our business may be harmed. in addition, if our efforts to expand do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue or result in a decrease in our operating margin, our financial results will be adversely impacted. if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel or if new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or increase our revenue. additionally, our technical applications specialists work closely with researchers and clinicians to optimize and implement new panels and applications to meet their specific needs. hiring these highly skilled specialists is competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary scientific and technical backgrounds and ability to understand our products at a technical level, and training such individuals requires significant time, expense and attention. furthermore, we face intense competition in the labor market for such highly skilled specialists from competitors in our industry as well as competition from companies in other industries. to effectively support current and potential customers, we will need to hire, maintain, train and grow the number of our technical application specialists and customer support staff. if we are unable to maintain, attract, train or retain the number of qualified support personnel that our business needs, our business and prospects will suffer. if we are unable to expand or leverage the number of peer-reviewed articles published using data generated by our products or otherwise increase brand awareness, the demand for our products and our business may be adversely affected. we rely on a significant base of peer-reviewed publications to showcase and validate the importance and application of our technology in academic and clinical research settings. to date, there have been more than peer-reviewed articles published, including many published in prominent journals, using data generated by our technology across a wide range of key scientific research areas, including immunology and inflammation, infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, oncology and others. we believe that expanding the base of these publications, and otherwise developing and maintaining awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving broad acceptance of our solutions and attracting new customers. such publications and other brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue and, even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the costs and expenses we incur in building our brand. if we fail to successfully promote, maintain and protect our brand, we may fail to attract or retain the customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our solutions. we are highly dependent on our senior management team and key personnel and our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for our success. we are highly dependent on our senior management team and key personnel. our success will depend on our ability to retain senior management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including sales, marketing, scientific and technical professionals, and to integrate current and additional personnel in all departments. the loss of members of our senior management, sales, marketing, scientific and technical professionals could result in lower than expected sales and delays in product development. if we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, it would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. competition for skilled personnel in our market is intense and has recently intensified further due to macro-economic conditions and industry trends in many areas where our employees are located. this may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. to induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have issued, and will in the future issue, equity awards that vest over time. the value to employees of equity awards that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, they may terminate their employment with us on short notice. our employment arrangements with our employees provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. many of the other cell analysis technology companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. they may also provide more diverse opportunities, better chances for career advancement and higher compensation. some of these characteristics are more appealing to high quality candidates than what we can offer. further, if we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources and, potentially, damages. in addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. if the perceived benefits of our stock awards decline, either because we are a public company or for other reasons, it may harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. many of our employees have become or will soon become vested in a substantial amount of their equity awards. our employees may be more likely to leave us if the equity they own have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly below the market price of our common stock, particularly after the expiration of the lock-up agreements described herein. our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain additional executive officers and other key employees as we expand our business and operations. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, it will negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have increased the size of our organization and expect to further increase it in the future, and we may experience difficulties in managing our growth. if we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be harmed. as of december , , we had full-time employees. as our sales and marketing strategies develop, we expect to need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other personnel. future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including: identifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees; managing our internal development efforts effectively, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and improving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. since our inception, we have experienced growth and anticipate further growth in our business operations both inside and outside the united states. this future growth could strain our organizational, administrative and operational infrastructure, including quality control, operational, finance, customer service and sales organization management. we expect to continue to increase our headcount and to hire more specialized personnel in the future as we grow our business. we will need to continue to hire, train and manage additional qualified scientists, engineers, technical personnel and sales and marketing staff and improve and maintain our products to properly manage our growth. rapid expansion in personnel could mean that less experienced people develop, market and sell our products, which could result in inefficiencies and unanticipated costs, reduced quality and disruptions to our operations. if our new hires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees or if we are not successful in retaining our employees, our business may be harmed. we may not be able to maintain the quality or expected turnaround times of our products, or satisfy customer demand as it grows. our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. the time and resources required to implement these new systems and procedures is uncertain, and failure to complete this in a timely, efficient and effective manner could adversely affect our operations. we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. if we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations. in connection with our financial statement close process for the year ended december , , we identified deficiencies in the control environment and control activities components of the committee of sponsoring organizations coso framework that constitute material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate. deficiencies in the control environment related to (i) the lack of a sufficient number of qualified resources within our accounting and it functions with the appropriate level of technical accounting or other requisite knowledge to (a) timely identify and assess accounting implications of transactions; and (b) perform assigned responsibilities and have appropriate accountability for the design and operation of internal control over financial reporting. deficiencies related to control activities related to (i) selecting and developing control activities that contribute to the mitigation of risks and support achievement of objectives; (ii) selecting and developing general control activities over technology to support the achievement of objectives; and (iii) deploying control activities through policies that establish what is expected and procedures that put policies into action and relate to substantially all financial statement accounts and disclosures please see the section entitled item a. controls and procedures for additional information. a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of its financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. these deficiencies could result in additional material misstatements to our consolidated financial statements that could not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. if we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or identify any additional material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be negatively impacted, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may decline as a result. we may need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations, develop our products and/or expand our operations. based on our current planned operations, we expect that our existing cash will enable us to fund our operating expenses for at least months from the date hereof. however, if our available cash balances and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or otherwise, we may seek to issue equity or convertible debt securities, enter into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding, seek other debt financing or enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements. we may consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons, including to further scale up our manufacturing of our products, to increase our sales and marketing efforts to drive market adoption of our products and address competitive developments, and to finance capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses. our present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: our ability to achieve and maintain revenue growth; the cost of expanding our operations, including our sales and marketing efforts; our rate of progress in launching and commercializing new products, and the cost of the sales and marketing activities associated with, establishing adoption of our products; our rate of progress in, and cost of research and development activities associated with, products in research and development; the effect of competing technological and market developments; the potential cost of and delays in product development as a result of any regulatory oversight applicable to our products; the costs associated with any product recall that may occur; costs related to domestic and international expansion; the costs of attaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights; and the terms and timing of any other collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish. additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. weakness and volatility in the capital markets and the economy in general could limit our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing if we do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our existing stockholders rights. if we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. if we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaborations agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or products or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. in addition, our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the united states and worldwide resulting from the covid- pandemic, geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing war in ukraine, and rising interest rates. the global economy, including credit and financial markets, has experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in economic growth, increases in inflation rates, higher interest rates and uncertainty about economic stability. if the equity and credit markets further deteriorate, or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development, manufacturing or commercialization of our products, or other research and development initiatives. if this were to occur, our ability to grow and support our business and to respond to market challenges could be significantly limited, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide. our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. these fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to: the level of demand for any of our products, which may vary significantly; the timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research, development, manufacturing, regulatory approval and commercialization activities relating to our products, which may change from time to time; the size, seasonality and customer mix of the cell analysis market; sales and marketing efforts and expenses; the rate at which we grow our sales force and the speed at which newly-hired salespeople become effective; changes in the productivity of our sales force; the effectiveness of our distribution partners in selling our products; positive or negative coverage in the media or publications of our products or competitive products; the cost of manufacturing our products, which may vary depending on the quantity of production and the terms of our arrangements with our suppliers; the degree of competition in our industry and any change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including the introduction of new products or enhancements or technologies by us or others in the cell analysis market and competition-related pricing pressures; changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals or applications; future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting the industry in which we, including those related to the covid- pandemic or other widespread health crises; future global financial crises and economic downturns, including those caused by widespread public health crises; economic factors, including changes in inflation, interest rates, foreign currency rates, and the potential effect of such factors on revenues and expenses; and general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors. the cumulative effects of factors discussed above could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. as a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. this variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. if our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any guidance we may provide, or if the guidance we provide is below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated guidance we may provide. the sizes of the markets for our products may be smaller than we estimate. within the life sciences technology market, flow cytometry technologies currently provide solutions largely within cell proliferation, cell counting, cell identification, cell quality control and single-cell applications, representing an initial total addressable market tam of nearly billion. however, we believe that the enhanced capabilities of our fsp platform has the potential to capture an increasingly greater share of the broader cell analysis tam. our northern lights system has been approved for clinical use in the european union and china. in the united states, our products are currently labeled and promoted, and are, and in the near-future are expected to continue to be, sold primarily to academic and research institutions and biopharmaceutical companies as research use only products for non-diagnostic and non-clinical purposes, and are not currently designed, or intended to be used, for clinical diagnostic tests. we plan to continue generating supporting publications and data, as well as pursue any required regulatory approvals for clinical use for our products in the united states. our ability to penetrate the clinical markets in the united states will depend in part on our ability to receive (k) clearance, de novo classification, or approval of a pre-market approval application from the fda. further, we believe our differentiated platform will enable us to expand the use of cell analysis into new markets, well beyond current applications addressed by prior flow cytometry technologies and other cell analysis technologies. while we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates are reasonable, we have not independently verified the accuracy of the third-party data on which we have based our assumptions and estimates, and these assumptions and estimates may not be correct and significantly different than actual market sizes, and the conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, including as a result of factors outside our control, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. if the actual number of customers who would benefit from our products, the price at which we can sell products or the annual addressable market for our products is smaller than we have estimated, it may impair our sales growth and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, our growth strategy involves launching new solutions and expanding sales of existing solutions into new markets and geographies in which we have limited experience. for example, we intend to develop our platform s applications within the clinical market, and in particular, within disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring. sales of new or existing solutions into new market opportunities may take several years to develop and mature, and we cannot be certain that these market opportunities will develop as we expect. as a result, the sizes of the annual total addressable market for new markets and new products are even more difficult to predict. if we were to be sued for product liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources, limit sales of our existing products and limit commercialization of any products that we may develop. the marketing, sale and use of our products could lead to the filing of product liability claims where someone may allege that our products identified inaccurate or incomplete information or otherwise failed to perform as designed. we may also be subject to liability for errors in, a misunderstanding of or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide in the ordinary course of our business activities. a product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend. if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities and reputational harm. in addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in: substantial litigation costs; distraction of management s attention from our primary business; the inability to commercialize our products or new products; decreased demand for our products; damage to our business reputation; product recalls or withdrawals from the market; loss of sales; or termination of existing agreements by our partners and potential partners failing to partner with us. we maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against product liability claims. any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. while we may attempt to manage our product liability exposure by proactively recalling or withdrawing from the market any defective products, any recall or market withdrawal of our products may delay the supply of those products to our customers and may impact our reputation. we may not be successful in initiating appropriate market recall or market withdrawal efforts that may be required in the future and these efforts may not have the intended effect of preventing product malfunctions and the accompanying product liability that may result. such recalls and withdrawals may also harm our reputation with customers, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. litigation and other legal proceedings may harm our business. we have been, and may become, involved in legal proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property matters, product liability claims, employee claims, tort or contract claims, federal or state regulatory investigations, securities class actions and other legal proceedings or investigations, which could have a negative impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business. litigation is inherently unpredictable and can result in excessive or unanticipated verdicts and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or for agreements to change the way we operate our business, or both. there may be an increase in the scope of these matters or there may be additional lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations in the future, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers confidence and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. if our information technology systems or data, or those of third parties on which we rely, are compromised now, or in the future, we could experience adverse consequences resulting from such a compromise, including but not limited to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse consequences . in the ordinary course of our business, we and the third parties upon which we rely, collect, use, store, safeguard, disclose, share, transfer, secure and otherwise process (collectively, process or processing proprietary, confidential and sensitive data, including personal information (such as key-coded data, health information and other special categories of personal information), intellectual property, trade secrets and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves, our customers and other parties (collectively sensitive information ). we may rely upon third parties (such as service providers) for our data processing related activities. we may share or receive sensitive information with or from third parties. we face a variety of evolving threats, which could cause security incidents. cyber-attacks, malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our sensitive information and information technology systems, and those of the third parties upon which we rely. such threats are prevalent and continue to rise, are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, and come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer hackers, threat actors, hacktivists, organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors. some actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks, including without limitation, nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. during times of war and other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including cyber-attacks, that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services. we and the third parties upon which we rely may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), credential harvesting, personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, and other similar threats. in particular, severe ransomware attacks, including those perpetrated by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of sensitive information and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. additionally, employees working from home, while in transit and in public locations poses increased risks to our information technology systems and data when utilizing network connections, computers, and devices outside our premises or network. in addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to undermine our competitive advantage or market position. future or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could also expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities systems and technologies. furthermore, we may discover security issues that were not found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be difficult to integrate companies into our information technology environment and security program. we rely on third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, data center facilities, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, and other functions. our ability to monitor these third parties information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. if our third-party service providers experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. while we may be entitled to damages if our third-party service providers fail to satisfy their data privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award. in addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners supply chains have not been compromised. any of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption that could result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to our sensitive information or our information technology systems, or those of the third parties upon whom we rely. a security incident or other interruption could disrupt our ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our platform. we may expend significant resources or modify our business activities in an effort to protect against security incidents. certain data privacy and security obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific security measures, industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and sensitive information. while we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. we take steps to detect and remediate vulnerabilities, but we may not be able to detect and remediate all vulnerabilities in our information technology systems because the threats and techniques used to exploit the vulnerability change frequently and are often sophisticated in nature. therefore, such vulnerabilities could be exploited but may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. these vulnerabilities pose a material risk to our business. applicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of security incidents. such disclosures are costly, and the disclosures or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences. if we (or a third party upon whom we rely) experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences, such as government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing data (including personal information); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational harm; monetary fund diversions; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. security incidents and attendant consequences may cause customers to stop using our products and services, deter new customers from purchasing our products and services, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business. further, our contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. we cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims. business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. our operations (including our manufacturing operations) and the operations of our distribution partners could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and pandemics, including the covid- pandemic, and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. our ability to obtain components for our products could be disrupted if the operations of our suppliers were affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption, including interruptions related to the covid- pandemic. in addition, our corporate headquarters is located in fremont, california and one of our reagents manufacturing facilities is located in san diego, california, near major earthquake faults and fire zones, and the ultimate impact on us for being located near earthquake faults and fire zones and being consolidated in a certain geographical area is unknown. the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. we manufacture our products at our manufacturing facilities located in fremont and san diego, california, and wuxi, china, and we rely on various suppliers in the united states, china and other countries. should our manufacturing facilities or the facilities of our suppliers be damaged or destroyed by natural or man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, fires or other events, or should events such as political unrest unfold, it could take months to relocate or rebuild, during which time our manufacturing and the operations of our suppliers would cease or be delayed and our products may be unavailable. moreover, the use of a new facility or new manufacturing, quality control, or environmental control equipment or systems generally requires fda review and approval. because of the time required to authorize manufacturing in a new facility under fda and non-u.s. regulatory requirements, we may not be able to resume production on a timely basis even if we are able to replace production capacity in the event we lose our manufacturing capacity. the inability to perform our manufacturing activities, combined with our limited inventory of materials and components and manufactured products, or the inability of our suppliers to continue their operations, may cause us to be unable to meet customer demand or harm our reputation, and we may be unable to reestablish relationships with such customers in the future. consequently, a catastrophic event or business interruption at our manufacturing facilities or at our suppliers facilities could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. our insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which leaves us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities. we do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. although we have general and product liability insurance that we believe is appropriate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. our current product liability insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if available, coverage may not be adequate to protect us against any future product liability claims. if we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we could be exposed to significant liabilities. a product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we do not carry specific hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property, casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from hazardous waste exposure or contamination. accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended. although we carry cyber insurance, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover our losses in the event of a security breach. additionally, no assurance can be given that such policies can be retained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur following an insurance claim. we also expect that operating as a public company will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. as a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees or as executive officers. we do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we use hazardous biological materials that require considerable expertise for handling, storage and disposal and may result in claims against us. we and third parties with whom we contract must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business, and could expose us to liability if our use of such hazardous materials cause injury. our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including flammables, toxics, corrosives and biologics. our research operations produce hazardous biological and chemical waste products, and we largely contract with third parties for the disposal of these products. federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. we are subject to periodic inspections by federal, state and local authorities to ensure compliance with applicable laws. compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may restrict our operations. if we do not comply with applicable regulations, we may be subject to fines and penalties. in the event of accidental contamination or injury from these materials or wastes, we could be liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources and our operations could be suspended or otherwise adversely affected. in addition, because our product contains metals and electronic components which are purchased from third-party vendors, we may be required under rules promulgated by the u.s. securities and exchange commission sec governing disclosure of the use of conflict minerals (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) to determine whether those minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of our products and, if so, conduct a country of origin inquiry with respect to all such minerals. if any such minerals may have originated in the democratic republic of the congo, or drc, or any of its adjoining countries, or covered countries, then we must conduct diligence on the source and chain of custody of those conflict minerals to determine if they originated in one of the covered countries and, if so, whether they financed or benefited armed groups in the covered countries. disclosures relating to the products that may contain conflict minerals, the country of origin of those minerals and whether they are drc conflict free must be provided in a form sd (and accompanying conflict minerals report, if required, to disclose the diligence undertaken by us in sourcing the minerals and our conclusions relating to such diligence). if we are required to submit a conflict minerals report, that report must be audited by an independent auditor pursuant to existing government auditing standards. compliance with this disclosure rule may be very time-consuming for our management and personnel (as well as time-consuming for our suppliers) and could involve the expenditure of significant amounts of money by us and them. disclosures mandated by this rule, which can be perceived by the market to be negative, may cause customers to refuse to purchase our products. the cost of compliance with the rule could adversely affect our results of operations. furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. we cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. we do not currently maintain separate environmental liability coverage and any accidental contamination or discharge or any resultant injury from these materials could result in significant cost to us in penalties, damages and suspension of our operations. we have received funding under the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act, or the cares act. in june , we executed a note in favor of wells fargo bank, national association, evidencing an unsecured loan, ppp loan ), in the aggregate principal amount of . million, which was made pursuant to the paycheck protection program, or the ppp. the ppp was established under the cares act, which was enacted on march , , and is administered by the u.s. small business administration, or the sba. we have used all of the proceeds from the loan to retain employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments and expect to repay the ppp loan in the second quarter of . on may , , we fully repaid the ppp loan. the ppp loan application required us to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the ppp loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. in , the sba, in consultation with the department of treasury, issued new guidance requiring borrowers to consider their ability to access other sources of liquidity before certifying in their loan applications that current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations. we made the certification in good faith after analyzing our financial situation and access to capital and believe that we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the ppp loan. however, the sba guidance and criteria are subject to interpretation, including by the new biden administration, and if we are found to have been ineligible, we could be subject to significant penalties. if we become subject to penalties, it could result in harm to our business, results of operation and financial condition. we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk. a substantial amount of our revenues is derived from international operations, and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the united states in the future. as we have experienced in the twelve months ended december , , where our prices are denominated in u.s. dollars, our sales and revenues could be adversely affected by declines in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. see the section titled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information on the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact. any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks. risks related to government regulation and our industry our products may become subject to more onerous regulation by the fda or other regulatory agencies in the future, which could increase our costs and delay or prevent sales of our products or commercialization of new products and product enhancements, thereby materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. currently, our northern lights clc system is available for clinical use in only china and the european union. our aurora and northern lights systems are otherwise available to customers as research use only ruo products. ruo products are regulated by the fda as medical devices. although medical devices are subject to stringent fda oversight, products that are intended for ruo and are labeled as ruo are exempt from compliance with most fda requirements, including premarket clearance or approval, manufacturing requirements and others. a product labeled ruo but which is actually intended for clinical diagnostic use may be viewed by the fda as adulterated and misbranded under the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act fdca ), and subject to fda enforcement action. the fda has indicated that when determining the intended use of a product labeled ruo, the fda will consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of the product, including how the product is marketed and to whom. the fda could disagree with our assessment that our products are properly marketed as ruos, or could conclude that products labeled as ruo are actually intended for clinical diagnostic use, and could take enforcement action against us, including requiring us to stop distribution of our products until we are in compliance with applicable regulations, which would reduce our revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. in the event that the fda requires us to obtain marketing authorization of our ruo products in the future, there can be no assurance that the fda will grant any clearance or approval requested by us in a timely manner, or at all. as part of our growth strategy, we plan to seek approval to offer our aurora and northern lights systems for clinical use in the united states and in other countries. in the united states, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under section (k) of the fdca, or approval of a premarket approval application from the fda, unless an exemption applies. the process of obtaining approval or clearance from the fda for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could take a significant period of time, require the expenditure of substantial resources, involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, require changes to products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. there can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals or clearances for any new products or for modifications to our existing products on a timely basis or that any approval or clearance will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements. moreover, even if we receive fda clearance or approval of new products or modifications to existing products, we will be required to comply with extensive regulations relating to the development, research, clearance, approval, distribution, marketing, advertising and promotion, manufacture, adverse event reporting, recordkeeping, import and export of such products, which may substantially increase our operating costs and have a material impact on our business, profits and results of operations. failure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as: warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, termination of distribution, recalls or seizures of products, delays in the introduction of products into the market, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to grant future clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products, and in the most serious cases, criminal penalties. occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. we and our suppliers are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. any medical device we market will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight, requirements, and periodic inspections by the fda and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies. in particular, unless exempt, we and our suppliers are required to comply with the fda s quality system regulation qsr and other regulations enforced outside the united states which cover the manufacture of our products and the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of medical devices. regulatory bodies, such as the fda, enforce the qsr and other regulations through periodic inspections. the failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the fda and other regulatory bodies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following enforcement actions: untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; customer notifications for repair, replacement or refunds; recall, detention or seizure of our products; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing or delaying our requests for (k) clearance or pma approval of new products or modified products; withdrawal of (k) clearances on pma approvals that have already been granted; refusal to grant export approval for our products; or criminal prosecution. if any of these actions were to occur, our reputation would be harmed and our product sales and profitability would be adversely impacted. furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all. later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as the qsr, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects. any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our products. if regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory clearance or approval is withdrawn, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our products or any component thereof may be subject to product recalls in the future. a recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the fda or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us. the fda has the authority to require the recall of commercialized products that are subject to fda regulation. manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any deficiency is found. for reportable corrections and removals, companies are required to make additional periodic submissions to the fda after initiating the recall, and often engage with the fda on their recall strategy prior to initiating the recall. a government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable health risk, component failures, failures in laboratory processes, malfunctions, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects, or other deficiencies and issues. recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. we may also be subject to liability claims, be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may negatively impact our future sales and our ability to generate profits. companies are also required to maintain certain records of corrections and removals, even if these do not require reporting to the fda. we may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products. a recall announcement by us could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, the fda or other agency could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted. if we initiate a recall, including a correction or removal, for one of our products, issue a safety alert, or undertake a field action or recall to reduce a health risk, this could lead to increased scrutiny by the fda, other governmental and regulatory enforcement bodies, and our customers regarding the quality and safety of our products, and to negative publicity, including fda alerts, press releases, or administrative or judicial actions. furthermore, the submission of these reports could be used against us by competitors and cause customers to delay purchase decisions or cancel orders, which would harm our reputation. the misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation in the marketplace, or result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business. moreover, we could be subject to fda sanctions if we are deemed to have engaged in off-label promotion. our promotional materials and training methods must comply with fda and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition on the promotion of an ruo device or medical device for an indication that has not been approved or cleared by the fda, referred to as an off-label use. we cannot prevent our customers from using our products for off-label uses, including in laboratory developed tests for clinical use. if the fda determines that our promotional materials constitute the unlawful promotion of an off-label use, it could subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including civil money penalties, criminal fines and penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal health programs, among others. other federal, state or foreign governmental authorities might also take action if they consider our promotion or training materials to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities. in that event, our reputation could be damaged and the use of our products in the marketplace could be diminished. furthermore, off-label uses of our products may lead to performance issues or produce erroneous results, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace and increase the risk of product liability. product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management s attention from our primary business and result in substantial damage awards against us. any of these events could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. changes in tariffs or other government trade policies may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations, including by reducing demand for our products. the imposition of tariffs and trade restrictions as a result of international trade disputes or changes in trade policies may adversely affect our sales and profitability. for example, in and , the u.s. government imposed and proposed, among other actions, new or higher tariffs on specified imported products originating from china in response to what it characterized as unfair trade practices, and china responded by imposing and proposing new or higher tariffs on specified u.s. products. there can be no assurance that a broader trade agreement will be successfully negotiated between the united states and china to reduce or eliminate these tariffs. these tariffs, and the related geopolitical uncertainty between the united states and china, may cause decreased demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. for example, certain of our foreign customers may respond to the imposition of tariffs or threat of tariffs on products we produce by delaying purchase orders or purchasing products from our competitors. ongoing international trade disputes and changes in trade policies could also impact economic activity and lead to a general contraction of customer demand. in addition, tariffs on components that we may import from china or other nations will adversely affect our profitability unless we are able to exclude such components from the tariffs or we raise prices for our products, which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors. future actions or escalations by either the united states or china that affect trade relations may also negatively affect our business, or that of our suppliers or customers, and we cannot provide any assurances as to whether such actions will occur or the form that they may take. to the extent that our sales or profitability are negatively affected by any such tariffs or other trade actions, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. we are subject to governmental export controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws. exports of our products are subject to export controls and sanctions laws and regulations imposed by the u.s. government and administered by the u.s. departments of state, commerce, and treasury. u.s. export control laws may require a license or other authorization to export products to certain destinations and end users. in addition, u.s. economic sanctions laws include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities. obtaining export licenses can be difficult, costly and time-consuming and we may not always be successful in obtaining necessary export licenses, and our failure to obtain required export approval for our products or limitations on our ability to export or sell our products imposed by export control or sanctions laws may harm our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. noncompliance with these laws could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. we are subject to stringent and changing u.s. and foreign data privacy and security laws, regulations, rules, and standards as well as policies, contractual obligations, and other obligations related to data privacy and security. our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to government regulatory investigations or enforcement actions (that could include fines and penalties), a disruption of our business or commercialization of our products, private litigation, harm to our reputation, loss of revenue or profits, and other adverse effects on our business or prospects. in the course of our operations, we collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share sensitive, confidential, and proprietary information, including personal information, business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, and sensitive third-party data. accordingly, we are, and may increasingly become, subject to various data privacy and security laws, the number and scope of which are changing, subject to differing applications and interpretations, may be inconsistent among jurisdictions, and may conflict with each other. in the united states, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal information privacy and security laws, and consumer protection laws (e.g., section of the federal trade commission act), and other similar laws (e.g., wiretapping laws). for example, the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa ), as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech ), imposes specific requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. the california consumer privacy act of ccpa applies to personal information of consumers, business representatives, and employees, and requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of california residents to exercise certain rights related to their personal information. the ccpa allows for statutory fines for noncompliance (up to , per violation) and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. in addition, the california privacy rights act of cpra expands the ccpa s requirements, including by adding a new right for individuals to correct their personal information and establishing a new regulatory agency, the california privacy protection agency, to implement and enforce the law, which could increase the risk of an enforcement action. other states have enacted data privacy and security laws. for example, virginia, colorado, utah, and connecticut have similarly enacted comprehensive data privacy and security laws, all of which become effective in . similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels. if we become subject to new data privacy and security laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase because we may become subject to additional obligations, and the number of individuals or entities that can initiate actions against us may increase (including individuals via a private right of action and state actors), increasing legal risk and compliances costs for us and the third parties upon whom we rely. outside the united states, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards apply to data privacy and security. for example, the european union s general data protection regulation eu gdpr and the united kingdom s general data protection regulation uk gdpr impose strict requirements for processing the personal information of individuals located, respectively within the european economic area eea and the united kingdom uk ). for example, violations of the eu and uk gdpr can result in, temporary or definitive bans on data processing and other corrective actions; fines of up to million euros . million for the uk gdpr) or of annual global revenue, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to processing of personal information brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests. furthermore, in europe, there is a proposed regulation related to artificial intelligence ai that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations related to the use of ai-related systems. other countries outside of europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar comprehensive data privacy and security laws and regulations, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business. for example, china s personal information protection law pipl broadly regulates data privacy and security practices and imposes strict requirements for processing personal information. as another example, canada has enacted the personal information protection and electronic documents act and canada s anti-spam legislation, which broadly regulate the processing of personal information and impose compliance obligations and penalties comparable to those of european data privacy and security laws. complying with these and other similar laws and regulations (to the extent applicable) may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to change our business practices, and could lead to material fines, penalties and liability. in addition, many jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border persona information transfer laws. these laws may make it more difficult for us to transfer personal information across jurisdictions, which could impede our business. for example, absent appropriate safeguards or other circumstances, the eu gdpr generally restricts the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the eea, such as the united states, which the european commission does not consider to provide an adequate level of data privacy and security. the european commission released a set of standard contractual clauses that are designed to be a mechanism by which entities can transfer personal information out of the eea to jurisdictions that the european commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection. currently, these standard contractual clauses are a valid mechanism to transfer personal information outside of the eea. the standard contractual clauses, however, require parties that rely upon that legal mechanism to comply with additional obligations, such as conducting transfer impact assessments to determine whether additional security measures are necessary to protect the at-issue personal information. moreover, due to potential legal challenges, there exists some uncertainty regarding whether the standard contractual clauses will remain a valid mechanism for transfers of personal information out of the eea, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal information to the united states or other countries. in addition, laws in switzerland and the uk similarly restrict transfers of personal information outside of those jurisdictions to countries such as the united states of america that do not provide an adequate level of personal information protection. in addition to european restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal information, other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal information transfer laws and local personal information residency laws, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business. if we cannot implement a valid compliance mechanism for cross-border data transfers, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing or transferring personal information from europe or elsewhere. the inability to import personal information to the united states could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, including by limiting our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to european and other data privacy and security laws, requiring us to increase our personal information processing capabilities in europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense; increased exposure to regulatory actions; and substantial fines and penalties. additionally, companies that transfer personal information out of the eea and uk to other jurisdictions, particularly to the united states, are subject to increased scrutiny from regulators, individual litigants, and activist groups. some european regulators have ordered certain companies to suspend or permanently cease certain transfers out of europe for allegedly violating the gdpr s cross-border data transfer limitations. in addition to data privacy and security laws, privacy advocates and industry groups have proposed, and may propose in the future, standards with which we are legally or contractually bound to comply. for example, we may also be subject to the payment card industry data security standard pci dss ). the pci dss requires companies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information, including using and maintaining firewalls, adopting proper password protections for certain devices and software, and restricting data access. noncompliance with pci dss can result in penalties ranging from , to , per month by credit card companies, litigation, damage to our reputation, and revenue losses. we may also rely on vendors to process payment card data, and those vendors may be subject to pci dss, and our business may be negatively affected if our vendors are fined or suffer other consequences as a result of pci dss noncompliance. we are also bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. for example, certain data privacy and security laws, such as the eu/uk gdpr and the ccpa, require us to impose specific contractual restrictions on our service providers. we also publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. if these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences. our obligations related to data privacy and security are quickly changing in an increasingly stringent fashion and creating regulatory uncertainty. these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or in conflict among jurisdictions. preparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources (including, without limitation, financial and time-related resources), which may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal information on our behalf. in addition, these obligations may require us to change our business model. although we endeavor to comply with all applicable data privacy and security obligations, we may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) to do so. moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations which could impact our compliance posture and business operations. if we or the third parties on which we rely fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences. these consequences may include, but are not limited to, government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar); litigation (including class-action claims); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal information; orders to destroy or not use personal information; and imprisonment of company officials. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of customers, interruptions or stoppages in our business operations, inability to process personal information or to operate in certain jurisdictions, limited ability to develop or commercialize our products, expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry, adverse publicity, or revision or restructuring of our business model or operations. we are subject to u.s. and certain foreign anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. we can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations, which can harm our business. we are subject to anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the fcpa, the u.s. domestic bribery statute contained in u.s.c. , the u.s. travel act, the usa patriot act, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct or may in the future conduct activities. anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors and other third-party collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting or receiving, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to or from persons in the public or private sector. the fcpa also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. in addition to selling our products internationally directly through our sales teams, we currently engage third parties outside of the united states, and may engage additional third parties outside of the united states, to sell our products internationally and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations and other regulatory approvals. we have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors and other third-party collaborators, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. if we fail to comply with u.s. federal and state fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including those relating to kickbacks and false claims, we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be harmed. we are exposed to broadly applicable anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business, our arrangements and relationships with customers, and how we market, sell and distribute our products. we have a compliance program, code of conduct and associated policies and procedures, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent noncompliance may not be effective in protecting us from governmental investigations for failure to comply with applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. the laws that may affect our ability to operate include, among others: the anti-kickback statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willingly soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of a person, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs. the term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, and the government can establish a violation of the anti-kickback statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of the law or a specific intent to violate. in addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of the anti-kickback statute, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the fca. there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute; however, those exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and there may be limited or no exception or safe harbor for many common business activities. certain common business activities including, certain reimbursement support programs, educational and research grants or charitable donations, and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase or recommend medical devices, including discounts, providing items or services for free or engaging such people as consultants, advisors or speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within any available exception or safe harbor and would be subject to a facts and circumstances analysis to determine compliance with the anti-kickback statute. our business may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability; the federal civil false claims act, or the fca, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false claim paid or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the fca. actions under the fca may be brought by the government or as a qui tam action by a private person in the name of the government. these people, sometimes known as relators or, more commonly, as whistleblowers, may share in any monetary recovery. many medical device manufacturers have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the fca for a variety of alleged improper activities, including causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved and thus non-reimbursable uses and interactions with prescribers and other customers, including those that may have affected their billing or coding practices and submission of claims to the federal government. fca liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory monetary penalties for each false or fraudulent claim or statement. because of the potential for large monetary exposure, life sciences companies often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages and per claim penalties that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. settlements may require companies to enter into corporate integrity agreements with the government, which may impose substantial costs on companies to ensure compliance. medical device manufacturers and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs; hipaa, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making a materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. similar to the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation; hipaa, as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act, or hitech act, and their implementing regulations, also impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on covered entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, as well as their business associates that perform certain services for them or on their behalf involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; various state laws govern the privacy and security of personal information, including the california consumer protection act, or ccpa, which became effective january , , and gives california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers (as that term is broadly defined) and provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches; the federal physician payments sunshine act, implemented as open payments, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under medicare, medicaid or the children s health insurance program to report annually, with certain exceptions to cms, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to cms ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives; and analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require medical device companies to comply with the industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state beneficiary inducement laws, which are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. state and federal regulatory and enforcement agencies continue to actively investigate violations of healthcare laws and regulations, and the u.s. congress continues to strengthen the arsenal of enforcement tools. enforcement agencies also continue to pursue novel theories of liability under these laws. in particular, government agencies have increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement activity with respect to manufacturer reimbursement support activities, including bringing criminal charges or civil enforcement actions under the anti-kickback statute, fca and hipaa s healthcare fraud and privacy provisions. because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including certain sales and marketing practices of our products, could be subject to challenge under one or more such laws. if an arrangement were deemed to violate the anti-kickback statute, it may also subject us to violations under other fraud and abuse laws such as the federal civil fca and civil monetary penalties laws. moreover, such arrangements could be found to violate comparable state fraud and abuse laws. achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws may prove costly. if we or our employees are found to have violated any of the above laws we may be subjected to substantial criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as medicare and medicaid, and significant fines, monetary penalties, forfeiture, disgorgement and damages, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. any action or investigation against us for the violation of these healthcare fraud and abuse laws, even if successfully defended, could result in significant legal expenses and could divert our management s attention from the operation of our business. companies settling fca, anti-kickback statute or civil monetary penalties law cases also may enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the u.s. department of health and human services office of inspector general, or the oig, to avoid exclusion from participation (such as loss of coverage for their products) in federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid. corporate integrity agreements typically impose substantial costs on companies to ensure compliance. defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources, and may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, distributors and vendors may engage in fraudulent or illegal activity. misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: ( ) the laws of the fda and other similar regulatory bodies, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulators, ( ) manufacturing standards, ( ) healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the united states and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws, or ( ) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. these laws may impact, among other things, future sales, marketing and education programs. in particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. these laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commissions, certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. we have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to our directors, officers and employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent these activities may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. if any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, additional integrity reporting and oversight obligations, possible exclusion from participation in medicare, medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. whether or not we are successful in defending against any such actions or investigations, we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees and reputational harm, and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to obtain and maintain patent or other intellectual property protection for any of our current or future products, or if the scope of the patent and other intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our current or future products may be harmed. as with other flow cytometry companies, our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain, maintain and solidify a proprietary position for our current and any future products, which will depend upon our success in obtaining effective patent protection in the united states and other countries that cover, and other intellectual property with respect to, such products, their manufacturing processes and their intended methods of use and enforcing those patent claims once granted as well as our other intellectual property. in some cases, we may not be able to obtain issued patent claims or other intellectual property covering our technologies which are sufficient to prevent third parties, such as our competitors, from utilizing our products and negate any competitive advantage we may have. any failure to obtain or maintain patent and other intellectual property protection with respect to our current and any future products or other aspects of our business could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the united states and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions, obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights and, more generally, could affect the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patents. additionally, we cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors or other third parties. the patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. it is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output in time to obtain patent protection. although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, suppliers, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek and obtain patent protection. in addition, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends in part on whether the differences between our inventions and the prior art allow our inventions to be patentable over the prior art. furthermore, the publication of discoveries in scientific literature often lags behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the united states and other jurisdictions are typically not published until months after filing, or in some cases not at all. therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. as of december , , we own issued u.s. utility patents, two issued japan utility patents, one issued european utility patent and one issued china utility patent. we have pending utility patent applications, including utility patent applications in the united states, five utility patent applications in the european union, five utility patent applications in china and three utility patent applications in japan. assuming all maintenance fees are paid, the u.s. issued patents are expected to naturally expire between years and . patents covering intellectual property relating to design specific technologies invented by our researchers in shanghai and wuxi, china are filed in china and owned by our china subsidiaries, respectively. as of december , , our shanghai subsidiary owns issued utility patents and one issued invention patent and has ten pending invention patent applications and one pending utility patent application, and our wuxi subsidiary owns issued patents and has eight pending patent applications, including five pending utility model patent applications and eight pending invention patent applications. it is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents in a timely fashion or at all, and even if patents are granted, they may not provide a basis for intellectual property protection of commercially viable products or services, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties. it is possible that others will design around our current or future patented technologies. it is possible that in the future the scope, validity and enforceability of our patents, licensed patents, patent applications, trademarks, and trademark applications may be challenged at the united states patent and trademark office uspto or in proceedings before the patent offices of other jurisdictions. we may not be successful in defending any such challenges made against our patents, patent applications, trademarks or trademark applications. any successful third party challenge to our patents or trademarks could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents or trademarks and increased competition to our business. we may have to challenge the patents, patent applications, trademarks, or trademark applications of third parties. the outcome of patent litigation or other proceeding can be uncertain, and any attempt by us to enforce our patent rights against others or to challenge the patent rights of others may not be successful, or, if successful, may take substantial time and result in substantial cost, and may divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from or license to third parties or that we may jointly-own with third parties in the future and are therefore reliant on our licensors or licensees, and may be reliant on future joint-owners, licensors or licensees, to protect certain of our intellectual property used in our business. if our joint-owners, licensors or licensees fail to adequately protect this intellectual property or if we do not have exclusivity for the marketing of our products, whether because our joint-owners or licensors do not grant us exclusivity or they do not enforce the intellectual property against our competitors, our ability to commercialize products could suffer. therefore, these and any of our patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, for example, with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship and the like. if we or any of our current or future joint-owners, licensors or licensees fail to establish, maintain, protect or enforce such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. if any current or future joint-owners, licensors or licensees are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. if there are material defects in the form, preparation or prosecution of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid and/or unenforceable. any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may impact our ability to commercialize our products and materially harm our business. the strength of patent rights generally, and particularly the patent position of life sciences companies, involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain, and has been the subject of much litigation in recent years. this uncertainty includes changes to the patent laws through either legislative action to changes to statutory patent law or court action that may reinterpret existing law or rules in ways affecting the scope or validity of issued patents or the chances that patent applications will result in issued claims and the scope of any such claims. our current or future patent applications may fail to result in issued patents in the united states or foreign countries with claims that cover our current and any future products. even if patents do successfully issue from our patent applications, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of such patents, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. any successful challenge to our patents could deprive us of the exclusive rights necessary for the successful commercialization of our current and any future products, which may materially harm our business. furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents may not adequately protect our current and any future products, provide exclusivity for such products or prevent others from designing around the claims of our patents. if the scope of any patent protection we obtain is not sufficiently broad, or if we lose any of our patent protection, our ability to prevent our competitors from commercializing similar or identical technology and products would be adversely affected and would materially harm our business. if the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents we hold or pursue with respect to our current and any future products is challenged, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, or threaten our ability to commercialize, our current and any future products. patents have a limited lifespan. in the united states, the natural expiration of a utility patent is generally years after its effective filing date and the natural expiration of a design patent is generally years after its issue date, unless the filing date occurred on or after may , , in which case the natural expiration of a design patent is generally years after its issue date. however, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries. various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. without patent protection for our current and any future products and services, we may be open to competition, which may harm our business prospects. further, if we encounter delays in our development efforts, the period of time during which we could market our current and any future products and services under patent protection would be reduced and, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of planned or future products, patents protecting our current and any future products might expire before or shortly after such products are commercialized. as our patents expire, the scope of our patent protection will be reduced, which may reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage afforded by our patent portfolio. as a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. moreover, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. even if patent applications we license or own, currently or in the future, issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. any patents that we own now or in the future may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. consequently, we do not know whether our current and any future products or other technologies will be protectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable patents. our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. some of our patents and patent applications may in the future be jointly-owned with third parties, including certain universities and public institutions in the united states and china. if we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third-party joint-owners interest in such patents or patent applications, such co-owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. in addition, we may need the cooperation of any such joint-owners patents to enforce such patents against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us. any of the foregoing could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. additionally, we may find it necessary or prudent to acquire or obtain licenses from third-party intellectual property holders. however, we may be unable to acquire or secure such licenses to any intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our current and any future products. the acquisition or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and our competitors may pursue strategies to acquire or license third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. our competitors may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater development and commercialization capabilities. in addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. we also may be unable to acquire or license third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment or at all. if we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of the relevant products, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. patents covering our current, and any future products, or our technologies could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies in the united states or abroad, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts, the uspto or patent offices abroad and may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantage against competitors with similar products. we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the uspto or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, post-grant and inter partes review ipr ), or interference proceedings or other similar proceedings challenging our patent rights. an adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate or render unenforceable, such patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our current and any future products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. moreover, we may have to participate in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions in a foreign patent office, that challenge features of patentability with respect to our patents and patent applications. such challenges may result in loss of patent rights, in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our current and any future products or technologies. such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. in addition, if we initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our current and any future products, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. in patent litigation in the united states, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the uspto or made a misleading statement during prosecution. defenses of these types of claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. third parties may also raise claims challenging the validity or enforceability of our patents before administrative bodies in the united states or abroad, even outside the context of litigation, including through re-examination, post-grant review, ipr, derivation proceedings and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (such as opposition proceedings). such proceedings could result in the revocation of, cancellation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover or provide meaningful protection of our current and any future products or technologies. the outcome for any particular patent following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. with respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. if a defendant or other third-party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our current and any future products and technology. such a loss of patent protection would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely substantially on our trademarks and trade names. if our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be harmed. we rely substantially upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand. our registered and unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be violating or infringing on other marks. we may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we rely upon to build name recognition among potential partners and customers in our markets of interest. at times, competitors or other third parties may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion and asserting claims against such third parties may be prohibitively expensive. in addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement or dilution claims brought by owners of other trademarks against us. over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names or other intellectual property may be ineffective, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. obtaining and maintaining our intellectual property, including patent, protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government agencies, and our intellectual property, including patent, protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on intellectual property registrations and applications will be due to be paid to the applicable government agencies, including with respect to patents and patent applications the uspto and similar agencies outside of the united states, over the lifetime of our intellectual property registrations and applications, including our patents and patent applications. the various applicable government agencies, including with respect to patents and patent applications the uspto and similar agencies outside of the united states, require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the application process. in some cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. there are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in the abandonment or lapse of the intellectual property registration or application, resulting in a partial or complete loss of intellectual property rights in the relevant jurisdiction. non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of an intellectual property registration or application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. in such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market with similar or identical products or technology, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have limited foreign intellectual property rights outside the united states, selected countries in the european union, japan and china and may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have limited intellectual property rights outside the united states, selected countries in the european union, japan and china. filing, prosecuting and defending patents or trademarks on our current and any future products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions or utilizing our trademarks in all countries outside the united states, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the united states or other jurisdictions. competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the united states. these products may compete with our current and any future products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. proceedings to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. we may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. in addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the united states and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of our intellectual property. changes in u.s. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our current and any future products. changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the united states could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, prior to march , in the united states, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the united states, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. after march , under the leahy-smith america invents act, or the america invents act, enacted in september , the united states transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third-party was the first to invent the claimed invention. a third-party that files a patent application in the uspto after march , but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by such third-party. this will require us to be cognizant of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. since patent applications in the united states and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our current and any future products. the america invents act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. these include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the uspto during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by uspto administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, ipr and derivation proceedings. because of a lower evidentiary standard in uspto proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in u.s. federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third-party could potentially provide evidence in a uspto proceeding sufficient for the uspto to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. accordingly, a third-party may attempt to use the uspto procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third-party as a defendant in a district court action. therefore, the america invents act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. in addition, future actions by the u.s. congress, the federal courts and the uspto could cause the laws and regulations governing patents to change in unpredictable ways. any of the foregoing could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, recent u.s. supreme court rulings have made and will likely continue to make changes in how the patent laws of the united states are interpreted. in addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the validity and enforceability of patents, once obtained. depending on future actions by the u.s. congress, the federal courts, and the uspto, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. we cannot predict how this and future decisions by the courts, the u.s. congress or the uspto may impact the value of our patents. any similar adverse changes in the patent laws of other jurisdictions could also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation against us, the joint-owners of our intellectual property, or our collaborators may prevent or delay the sale and marketing of our current and any future products. the flow cytometry industry is highly competitive and dynamic. due to the focused research and development that is taking place by several companies, including us and our competitors, in this field, the intellectual property landscape is in flux, and it may remain uncertain in the future. as such, we could become subject to significant intellectual property-related litigation and proceedings relating to our or third-party intellectual property and proprietary rights. such litigation and proceedings may cause us to incur significant expense, including the payment of damages, settlement payments and/or royalty payments. for example, in february , bd filed suit against us and certain of our employees in the united states district court for the northern district of california asserting a number of claims against us, including misappropriation of trade secrets and copyright infringement. in october , we entered into a settlement agreement with bd resulting in a dismissal of all claims and a release of all claims between the parties. pursuant to the settlement agreement with bd, we are required to make certain payments to bd, including royalty payments on sales of certain of our products. our commercial success depends in part on our and any potential future collaborators ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell any products that we may develop and use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the patents and other intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties. it is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us or any potential collaborators to alter our development or commercial strategies, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. the medical device industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, as well as administrative proceedings for challenging patents, including interference, inter partes or post-grant review, derivation and reexamination proceedings before the uspto or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. third parties, including our competitors, may currently have patents or obtain patents in the future and claim that the manufacture, use or sale of our current and any future products infringes upon these patents. we have not conducted an extensive search of patents issued or assigned to other parties, including our competitors, and no assurance can be given that patents containing claims covering our current and any future products, components of our current and any future products, technology or methods do not exist, have not been filed or could not be filed or issued. in addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue and because publication schedules for pending applications vary by jurisdiction, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware and which may result in issued patents which our current or future products infringe. also, because the claims of published patent applications can change between publication and patent grant, there may be published patent applications that may ultimately issue with claims that we infringe. as the number of competitors in our market grows and the number of patents issued in this area increases, the possibility of patent infringement claims against us escalates, increasing the risk that we will be required to incur significant expenses defending any such claims or lose patent protection for our current or future products. we may also be subject to claims that current or former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. for example, we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing our current and any future products. litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship of our patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. if we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to our current and any future products. if we were to lose exclusive ownership of such intellectual property, other owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors. we also may be required to obtain and maintain licenses from third parties, including parties involved in any such disputes. such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or may be non-exclusive. if we are unable to obtain and maintain such licenses, we may need to cease the development, manufacture and commercialization of one or more of our current and any future products. the loss of exclusivity or the narrowing of our patent claims could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products. even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. any of the foregoing could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. in the event that any third-party claims that we infringe their patents or that we are otherwise employing their proprietary technology without authorization and initiates litigation against us, even if we believe such claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity, enforceability or priority. a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed by our current and any future products, which could harm our ability to commercialize any product we may develop and any other technologies covered by the asserted third-party patents. to successfully challenge the validity of any such u.s. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. as this burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such u.s. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such u.s. patent. if we are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, including patents, and we are unsuccessful in demonstrating that such patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable, such third parties may be able to block our ability to commercialize the applicable products or technology unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay significant license fees and/or royalties, and the rights granted to us might be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same technology. if we are unable to obtain a necessary license to a third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may be unable to commercialize our current and any future products, or such commercialization efforts may be significantly delayed, which could in turn significantly harm our business. defense of infringement claims, regardless of their merit or outcome, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from our business, and may impact our reputation. in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be enjoined from further developing or commercializing the infringing products and/or have to pay substantial damages for use of the asserted intellectual property, including treble damages and attorneys fees were we found to willfully infringe such intellectual property. claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. we also might have to redesign our infringing products or technologies, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. engaging in litigation to defend against third-party infringement claims is very expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. in addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial negative impact on our common stock price. such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. we may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of litigation or administrative proceedings more effectively than we can because of greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings against us could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. the occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful. competitors may infringe our patents, or the patents of any future licensing partners, or we may be required to defend against claims of infringement. in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that our patent is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover such technology. an adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our management and other personnel from their normal responsibilities. in addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial negative impact on our common stock price. such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. we may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace. any of the foregoing could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. further, many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. in addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. in these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. if we are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. we may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property. such claims could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. as is common in the life sciences industry, our employees, consultants and advisors may be currently or previously employed or engaged at universities or other life sciences companies, including our competitors and potential competitors. although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may in the future become subject to claims that we or these people have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of their current or former employer. also, we may in the future be subject to claims that these people are violating non-compete agreements with their former employers. litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. if we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. in addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. the assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. such claims could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. in addition to seeking patent protection for our current and any future products, we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. we seek to protect such proprietary information, in part, through non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, collaborators, contractors, advisors, consultants and other third parties and invention assignment agreements with our employees. we also have agreements with our consultants that require them to assign to us any inventions created as a result of their working with us. the confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses containing invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with employees or third parties. we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that has or may have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary information. additionally, despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. in addition, some courts inside and outside the united states are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third-party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. if any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor or other third-party, our competitive position would be materially and adversely harmed. furthermore, we expect these trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information to over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology and the movement of personnel from academic to scientific industry positions. we also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. while we have confidence in these people, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. in addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known, or be independently discovered by, competitors. to the extent that our employees, consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. failure of a key information technology system, process, or site could have an adverse effect on our business. we rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct our business. these systems affect, among other things, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, shipping products, processing transactions, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, data security and other processes necessary to manage our business. our systems and the data contained on them may be subject to computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, attacks by computer hackers, social engineering (including phishing), supply chain attacks, credential stuffing, efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations, errors or malfeasance of our personnel, and security vulnerabilities in the software or systems on which we rely, and failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof. if the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our systems or our data is compromised due to these, or any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events and power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may experience interruptions in our operations, including corruption of our data or release of our confidential information, which could have an adverse effect on our business. furthermore, any breach in our information technology systems could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information, which may be protected by applicable laws. in addition, the covid- pandemic has generally increased the risk of cybersecurity intrusions. for example, there has been an increase in phishing and spam emails as well as social engineering attempts from hackers hoping to use the covid- pandemic to their advantage. any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could require substantial expenditures to remedy and could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and damage to our reputation. our use of open source software could compromise our ability to offer our services and subject us to possible litigation. we use open source software in connection with the software integrated in our instruments. companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging their use of open source software and compliance with open source license terms. as a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms. some open source software licenses require users who distribute software containing open source software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to the licensee s software that incorporates, links or uses such open source software, and make available to third parties for no cost, any derivative works of the open source code created by the licensee, which could include the licensee s own valuable proprietary code. while we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur, or could be claimed to have occurred, in part because open source license terms are often ambiguous. there is little legal precedent in this area and any actual or claimed requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could harm our business and could help third parties, including our competitors, develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours. any of the foregoing could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. risks related to ownership of our common stock our stock price may be volatile, and the value of our common stock may decline. the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume. in addition to the factors discussed in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report on form -k, these factors include: the degree and rate of market adoption of our products; variance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts or investors; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of anticipated or unanticipated demand based on seasonal factors; changes in our projected operating and financial results; developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation; negative publicity associated with issues related to our products; changes in senior management or key personnel; future sales of our common stock or other securities, by us or our stockholders, as well as the anticipation of lock-up releases; the trading volume of our common stock; our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for our products; changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products; adverse developments concerning any of our third-party distribution partners and suppliers, including our single and sole-source suppliers; announcements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, acquisitions, or new offerings; our inability to engage additional distribution partners and establish collaborations, if needed; performance or news releases by other companies in our industry including about adverse developments related to safety, effectiveness, accuracy and usability of their products, reputational concerns, regulatory compliance, and product recalls; general economic, regulatory and market conditions, including economic recessions or slowdowns, the covid- pandemic, the ongoing war in ukraine and the general inflationary environment; and other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, pandemic, political, regulatory, and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. in addition, given the relatively small public float of shares of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market (the nasdaq ), the trading market for our shares may be subject to increased volatility. in the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that have experienced volatility or following a decline in the market price of its securities. this risk is especially relevant for us, because life sciences companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. if we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could harm our business. we have broad discretion in the use of our cash and may invest or spend the funds in ways with which you do not agree and in ways that may not yield a return. we have broad discretion over the use of our cash. investors may not agree with our decisions, and our use of cash may not yield any return on your investment. we currently intend to use our cash to fund manufacturing activities, sales and marketing activities, including the hiring and training of additional sales and marketing personnel, and the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, including research and development activities. in addition, a portion of our cash may also be used to acquire assets or complementary businesses. our failure to use our cash effectively could impair our ability to pursue our growth strategy or could require us to raise additional capital. in addition, pending their use, our cash may be placed in investments that do not produce income or that may lose value. if we do not invest or apply our cash in ways that enhance stockholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline. substantial future sales of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock will result in additional dilution of the percentage of ownership of our stockholders and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. sales and issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. we are unable to predict the effect that such sales and issuances may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. in addition, we may offer and sell up to million shares of common stock registered under our universal shelf registration statement on form s- pursuant to the sales agreement with piper in one or more at the market offerings. to date, we have not made any sales of common stock pursuant to the sales agreement. the extent to which we utilize the sales agreement with piper as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock, general market conditions and other restrictions and the extent to which we are able to secure funds from other sources. in addition, certain of our stockholders have registration rights that would require us to register shares owned by them for public sale in the united states. we have also filed a registration statement to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. as a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and applicable volume and restrictions that apply to affiliates, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding restricted stock unit awards are available for immediate resale in the united states in the open market. sales of shares of our common stock could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities in the future and at a price we deem appropriate. these sales could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock. concentration of ownership of our common stock among our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions. based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of december , , our executive officers, directors, holders of or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates, in the aggregate, own approximately . of our common stock. these stockholders, acting together, will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger or other significant corporate transactions. the interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with the interests of other stockholders. for example, because many of these stockholders purchased their shares at prices substantially below the current market price or our shares and have held their shares for a longer period, they may be more interested in selling our company to an acquirer than other investors, or they may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders. we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock. we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and may be restricted by the terms of any then-current debt instruments. accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud. we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of (the exchange act ). we designed our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec. we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. anti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control which could limit the market price of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. some of these provisions include: a board of directors divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board will be elected at one time; a prohibition on stockholder action through written consent, which requires that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president, or by a majority of the total number of authorized directors; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors; a requirement that no member of our board of directors may be removed from office by our stockholders except for cause and, in addition to any other vote required by law, upon the approval of not less than two-thirds of all outstanding shares of our voting stock then entitled to vote in the election of directors; a requirement of approval of not less than two-thirds of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend any bylaws by stockholder action or to amend specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and the authority of the board of directors to issue redeemable convertible preferred stock on terms determined by the board of directors without stockholder approval and which redeemable convertible preferred stock may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock. in addition, because we are incorporated in delaware, we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporate law, which may prohibit certain business antitakeover provisions and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirors to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors and could also delay or impede a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing or cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, or other employees, arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, (iv) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, (v) any action or proceeding as to which the delaware general corporation law confers jurisdiction to the court of chancery of the state of delaware and (vi) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. these provisions would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the exchange act. furthermore, section of the securities act of (the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such securities act actions. accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. to prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws will further provide that the federal district courts of the united states of america will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act. while the delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. in such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws. this may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and the provisions may not be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. these exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. furthermore, the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies certificates of incorporation or bylaws has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. if a court were to find either exclusive forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business. general risk factors as a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control and procedures over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls in a timely or efficient manner may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock. we are required, pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control and procedures over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending december , , which is the year covered by the second annual report following the completion of our ipo. this assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. in addition, based on the total annual gross revenue of the fiscal year ended december , , we ceased to be an emerging growth company, a smaller reporting company or a non-accelerated filer as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of (the jobs act ), as of december , . as a result, we will also be required to include in our annual report an attestation report by our independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting, beginning with respect to the fiscal year ending december , . we have begun the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with section , and we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. our compliance with section will require that we incur substantial accounting, legal and other compliance expense and expend significant management efforts. we currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to hire additional accounting and finance staff and consultants with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with section . if we are unable to conclude that our internal control and procedures over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, it would be possible that a material misstatement of our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and as a result, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the sec or other regulatory authorities. failure to remedy any material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock. the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. for example, in connection with the revenue accounting standard, accounting standards codification, or asc, topic , management makes judgments and assumptions based on our interpretation of the new standard. the revenue standard is principle-based and interpretation of those principles may vary from company to company based on their unique circumstances. it is possible that interpretation, industry practice and guidance may evolve as we apply the standard. if our assumptions underlying our estimates and judgments relating to our critical accounting policies change or if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions, estimates or judgments, our operating results may be adversely affected and could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock. we could be subject to securities class action litigation. in the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following a decline in the market price of its securities. this risk is especially relevant for us because life sciences companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. if we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could harm our business. we will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices. as a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. we expect such expenses to further increase as we are no longer an emerging growth company. the sarbanes-oxley act, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, the listing requirements of nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. furthermore, the senior members of our management team do not have significant experience with operating a public company. as a result, our management and other personnel will have to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur as a public company or the timing of such costs, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our failure to meet nasdaq s continued listing requirements could result in a delisting of our common stock. if we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of nasdaq, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. in the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with the listing requirements of nasdaq. if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business, our common stock price and trading volume could decline. our stock price and trading volume will be heavily influenced by the way analysts and investors interpret our financial information and other disclosures. if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, delay publishing reports about our business or publish negative reports about our business, regardless of accuracy, our common stock price and trading volume could decline. the trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. we do not have any control over these analysts. if the number of analysts that cover us declines, demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline. even if our common stock is actively covered by analysts, we do not have any control over the analysts or the measures that analysts or investors may rely upon to forecast our future results. over-reliance by analysts or investors on any particular metric to forecast our future results may result in forecasts that differ significantly from our own. regardless of accuracy, unfavorable interpretations of our financial information and other public disclosures could have a negative impact on our stock price. if our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates, for any of the reasons discussed above or otherwise, or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or change their opinion of our common stock, our stock price would likely decline. our ability to use our net operating losses nols to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. as of december , , we had no federal and state nol carryforwards. certain state nols will begin to expire in the calendar year , unless previously utilized. certain nol carryforwards subject to expiration could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. under the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ), as modified by the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act, or cares act, federal nols incurred in taxable years beginning after december , may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal nols in taxable years beginning after december , is limited to of taxable income in such years. there is variation in how states have responded and may continue to respond to the tax act and cares act. in addition, for state income tax purposes, there may be periods during which the use of nols is suspended or otherwise limited. separately, under section of the internal revenue code of , as amended code if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, which is generally defined as a greater than change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change nol carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. similar rules may apply under state tax laws. we determined that an ownership change occurred on september , , october , , and in connection with our ipo on july , . as of december , , we had not experienced an ownership change subsequent to the ownership change on july , . in addition, we may in the future experience ownership changes, as a result of changes in our stock ownership (some of which are not in our control). if an ownership change occurs, our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards and other tax attributes to reduce future tax liabilities may be limited. many states have provisions similar to code section . annual limitations may result in the expiration of the state net operating loss carryforwards before utilization. changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. our effective tax rate could increase due to several factors, including: changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates; changes in tax laws, tax treaties, and regulations or the interpretation of them; changes to our assessment about our ability to realize our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business; the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals; and limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions. additionally, a tax authority may disagree with tax positions that we have taken, which could result in increased tax liabilities. for example, a tax authority could assert that we are subject to tax in a jurisdiction where we believe we have not established a taxable connection, often referred to as a permanent establishment under international tax treaties, and such an assertion, if successful, could increase our expected tax liability in one or more jurisdictions. changes in tax law and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the rules dealing with u.s. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by the internal revenue service, the u.s. treasury department and other governmental bodies. changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. in recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. we urge investors to consult with their legal and tax advisers regarding the implication of potential changes in tax laws on an investment in our common stock. changes and uncertainties in the tax system in the countries in which we have operations, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and reduce net returns to our shareholders. we conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions. our consolidated effective income tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors, including: changing tax laws, regulations and treaties, or the interpretation thereof; tax policy initiatives and reforms under consideration; the practices of tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties. we are unable to predict what tax reform may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase the estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our statement of financial position, and otherwise affect our financial position, future results of operations, cash flows in a particular period and overall or effective tax rates in the future in countries where we have operations, reduce post-tax returns to our shareholders and increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance. item b'"

furthermore, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by applicable law. unless the context otherwise requires, the terms blackline, inc., the company, we, us and our in this annual report on form -k refer to the consolidated operations of blackline, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole. item . business overview we have created comprehensive cloud-based solutions designed to transform and modernize accounting and finance operations for mid-market and enterprise organizations in all industries globally. our secure, scalable solutions support critical financial close, accounts receivable and intercompany accounting processes. by introducing software to automate these processes and to enable them to function continuously, we empower our customers to improve the integrity of their financial reporting, increase efficiency in their accounting and finance processes and enhance real-time visibility into their results and operations. critical accounting and finance processes underlie the integrity of an organization s financial reports. the lack of effective accounting and finance tools can result in inefficient and cumbersome processes and, in some cases, accounting errors, restatements and write-offs, as well as material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. traditional enterprise resource planning (\"erp\") systems do not generally provide effective solutions for processes handled outside of an organization s general ledger, such as balance sheet substantiation, cash application, and intercompany transaction accounting. many organizations also use multiple erps and other financial systems without a platform to efficiently integrate them. as a result, to manage these tasks, organizations rely on spreadsheets and other error-prone and labor-intensive processes. these traditional manual accounting processes require significant time, increase the risk of error, and are unsuited for the increasing regulatory complexity and transaction volumes encountered by many modern businesses. we believe that we are creating a new category of powerful cloud-based software that is capable of automating and streamlining accounting and finance operations, in a manner that complements and supports traditional erp systems. we believe our customers benefit from cost savings through improvements in process efficiency, accuracy, and staff productivity, in addition to maximizing working capital and driving a faster financial close. our mission is to transform how accounting and finance departments operate, by delivering an indispensable platform to the controller. our approach modernizes accounting and finance operations by unifying accounting systems, data and processes; automating manual, repetitive activities; and enabling more real-time delivery of critical accounting information, a process we refer to as continuous accounting. our solutions help customers unify, orchestrate, and automate accounting processes while achieving greater accuracy, control, and transparency. we believe the need for our software has been driven by growing business and information technology complexities, transaction volumes and expanding regulatory requirements. our software integrates with, and obtains data from, more than different erp systems, including microsoft dynamics, oracle, and sap, as well as many other financial systems and applications such as bank accounts, sub-ledgers and in-house databases. we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, blackline systems, inc. blackline systems ). on september , , our company, blackline, inc., a delaware c-corporation, acquired blackline systems, a california s-corporation, and outside investors acquired a controlling interest in us, which we refer to as the acquisition. the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and resulted in a change in accounting basis as of the date of the acquisition. on october , , we acquired rimilia holdings ltd. rimilia ), which we refer to as the rimilia acquisition\". the primary purpose of the rimilia acquisition was to extend the company s capabilities into an adjacent area, adding accounts receivable automation to financial close automation. on january , , we acquired fourq systems, inc. fourq ), which we refer to as the fourq acquisition. the primary purpose of the fourq acquisition was to enhance our existing intercompany accounting automation capabilities by driving end-to-end automation of traditionally manual intercompany accounting processes. our cloud-based products include account reconciliations, transaction matching, task management, journal entry, variance analysis, consolidation integrity manager, compliance, blackline cash application, credit risk management, collections management, disputes deductions, team task management, ar intelligence, intercompany create functionality, intercompany processing, and netting and settlement. these products are offered to customers as scalable solutions that support critical accounting processes, such as the financial close, account reconciliations, cash application, intercompany accounting, and compliance. our growth strategy our principal growth strategies include the following: continue to innovate and expand our platform. our ability to internally develop or make strategic acquisitions of new, market-leading applications and functionalities is integral to our success, and we intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our applications to bring new solutions to accounting and finance. enhance our leadership position with enterprise market and mid-market companies. we believe we have a leading position in the enhanced financial controls and automation market with both enterprise and mid-market companies. we intend to leverage our brand, history of innovation, and customer focus to maintain and grow our leadership position with enterprise market businesses. in addition, we believe that mid-market businesses are particularly underserved and that our platform can help these businesses modernize their accounting and finance processes efficiently and effectively. increase existing customer spend through expanded usage and adoption of additional products. we pursue a land-and-expand sales model and believe there is significant opportunity to increase sales of our solutions within our existing customer base. our pricing model is designed to allow us to capture additional revenue as our customers usage of our platform grows, providing us with an opportunity to increase the lifetime value of our customer relationships. expand our international operations and customer footprint. we believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand the use of our cloud-based products outside the united states. we have an established presence in australia, canada, france, germany, india, japan, the netherlands, poland, romania, singapore, and the united kingdom, and we intend to invest in further expanding our footprint in these and other regions through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions. extend our customer relationships and distribution channels. we have established strong relationships with technology vendors such as sap and microsoft dynamics, professional services firms such as deloitte and ernst young, and business process outsourcers such as cognizant, genpact, and ibm. we intend to continue to strengthen and expand our existing relationships, seek new relationships, and further expand our distribution channels to help us expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets. blackline solutions we provide a powerful cloud-based solution designed to unify, automate, and streamline accounting and finance operations. the key elements of our solutions include: comprehensive platform we offer integrated suites of applications that deliver a broad range of capabilities to support critical accounting operations such as the financial close, accounts receivable, and intercompany accounting processes. the technology underpinning our software includes a comprehensive base of accounting-specific business logic and rules engines, which enable our customers to implement continuous accounting. enterprise integration we provide simple, secure and automated tools and integrations to transfer data to and from a range of enterprise-wide processes and systems, including erps, financial systems and in-house databases, and other custom applications and data. our solutions integrate with over erp systems, including microsoft dynamics, oracle, and sap. in addition, for companies with multiple systems and complex needs, we can connect with any number of general ledger systems simultaneously, resolving many of the issues associated with consolidating data across systems. independence our solutions are not dependent on any single operating system and work with most major erp systems our customers may use. our cross-system functionality allows us to reach a broader group of customers. we are also able to focus on and innovate for the needs of our customers irrespective of updates or changes in their existing systems. we believe this independence provides us with a competitive advantage in the industry over traditional methods. ease of use our solutions are designed by accountants, for accountants, to be intuitive and easy to use. we strive to enable any user to rapidly implement our software to manage their accounting and finance activities, from the simplest to the most sophisticated tasks. our user-friendly interface provides clear visualization of accounting and finance data, enables user collaboration, and streamlines business processes. innovation our ability to develop innovative products has been a key driver of our success and organic growth. through a history and culture of thought leadership, we have created a new category of powerful software that automates and streamlines antiquated, manual accounting processes to better meet our clients diverse and rapidly changing needs, and we continue to focus on providing advanced solutions to time and labor-intensive accounting practices. security our solutions and services incorporate industry best practices and meet internationally recognized standards with respect to information security and privacy management. we have implemented and maintain our certified information security management system and privacy information management system in accordance with the iso/iec , , , and standard requirements. we meet a breadth of requirements for our security control environment, including information security policies, organization of information security, human resource security, access control, cryptography, physical and environmental security, operations security, communications security, information security incident management, and information security aspects of business continuity management. in our continued commitment to customer trust, transparency, and security in service, we provide customers independently validated testing and evaluation of our control environment through issued reports and certifications. key benefits our platform is designed to provide the following benefits to our customers: flexibility and scalability our cloud solutions are designed for modern business environments and have broad applicability across enterprise and mid-market organizations in almost any industry. our solutions support complex corporate structures, provide integration across core financial systems, manage multiple currencies and languages, and scale to support high transaction volumes. embedded controls and workflow our solutions are designed for the complex global regulatory environment. our solutions embed key controls within standardized, repeatable and well-documented workflows, which are designed to result in substantially reduced risk of non-compliance or negative audit findings, greater tolerance for regulatory complexity and increased confidence in financial reports. real-time visibility we provide users with real-time visibility into the status, progress and quality of their accounting processes. with configurable dashboards, user-defined reporting and the ability to drill down to individual reconciliations, journals and tasks, users can track open items, identify bottlenecks within a process or intervene to prevent mistakes. automation and efficiency our solutions can ingest data from a variety of sources, including erp systems and other data repositories, and apply powerful, rules-driven automation to reconciliations, journals and transactions. this streamlines accounting processes, minimizes manual data entry and improves individual productivity to help ensure that accounting processes are timely completed. as a result, this automation allows users to focus on value-added activities instead of process management. continuous processing our solutions help organizations embed quality control, compliance and financial integrity into their day-to-day processes rather than rely on the traditional process of validating financial information at the end of each period. activities such as account reconciliation and variance analysis can be performed in real-time, thus reducing the risk of errors and creating a more agile accounting environment. customers our customers include multinational corporations, large enterprises and mid-market companies across a broad array of industries. these businesses include publicly-listed entities and privately-owned enterprises, as well as non-profit entities. at december , , we had , individual users across , customers exclusive of on-premise software. we define a customer as an entity with an active subscription agreement as of the measurement date. in situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. however, where an existing customer requests its invoice be divided for the sole purpose of restructuring its internal billing arrangement without any incremental increase in revenue, such customer continues to be treated as a single customer. products and services our cloud-based solutions for modern accounting are designed to be the primary system of interaction for accountants every day. our solutions unify systems and data and work to drive accuracy, collaboration, and accountability through visibility. by unifying and automating activity, we enable accounting departments to execute their work continuously, empowering real-time reporting and business partnership. these products are offered to our customers as scalable solutions for critical accounting processes, including financial close management, accounts receivable, and intercompany accounting. financial close management the collection of processes by which organizations reconcile, consolidate, and report their financial information at the end of each period is referred to as the financial close. for organizations of any size, the traditional way of closing the books is held together by manual processes and error-prone spreadsheets, increasing risk and threatening the accuracy of financial reporting. our financial close management solutions allow customers to standardize and automate key steps across the close process to ensure accuracy, control, and timeliness. account reconciliations provides a centralized workspace from which users can collaborate to complete account reconciliations. features include standardized templates, workflows for review and approval, linkage to policies and procedures, and integrated storage of supporting documentation. the product automates otherwise manual activities in the reconciliation process, significantly reducing time and effort and increasing productivity. it also enhances internal controls by facilitating the appropriate segregation of duties, simplifying reconciliation audits and adding transparency and visibility to the reconciliation process. transaction matching analyzes and reconciles high volumes of individual transactions from different sources of data based upon user-configured logic. our rules engine automatically identifies exceptions, errors, missing data, and variances within massive data sets. the matching engine processes millions of records per minute, can be used with any type of data and allows customers to reconcile transactions in real-time. task management enables users to create and manage processes and task lists. the product provides automatic and recurring task scheduling, includes configurable workflow and provides a management console for accounting and finance projects. though most commonly used with the financial close, users can create task lists and projects for hundreds of different use cases ranging from external audits to environmental impact surveys. journal entry allows users to manually or automatically generate, review and post manual journal entries. journals can be automatically allocated across multiple business units and calculated based on complex, client-defined logic. more importantly, the addition of validation and approval checkpoints helps ensure the integrity of information passed to other financial applications. customers can use the journal entry product to pass information to hundreds of different erps and subsystems in a configurable, easily consumable format. variance analysis provides always-on monitoring and automatically identifies anomalous fluctuations in balance sheet and income statement account balances. once an account in flux is identified, users are automatically alerted so they can research and determine the source of the fluctuation. consolidation integrity manager manages the automated system-to-system tie-out process that occurs during the consolidation phase of the financial close. companies with multiple erps utilize a consolidation system to produce their consolidated financial results. because these systems contain and produce information that changes continually and requires constant adjustments, a final tie-out that is typically handled manually in a spreadsheet is necessary prior to publishing results. this product automates the tie-out process, aggregating balances from dozens or hundreds of different systems and allowing users to identify exceptions and create adjustments quickly. compliance is an integrated solution that facilitates compliance-related initiatives, consolidates project management, and provides visibility over control self-assessments and testing. accounts receivable automation cash is vital to every business, and accounts receivable automation is central to improving cash flow. managing accounts receivable well means maximizing working capital by collecting cash and minimizing credit losses. this critical process is often highly manual. our unified suite of accounts receivable automation solutions ar solutions, helps customers collect cash, provide credit, and better understand cash flow. blackline cash application transforms the order-to-cash cycle by significantly reducing the time it takes to apply cash receipts to open invoices, resulting in significant reductions in unapplied cash. blackline cash application drives an automated and effective end-to-end process from an invoice to cash in the bank and fully applied in the subledger. it uses intelligent automation to help customers accurately apply payments to customers invoices in an erp. embedded machine learning then reduces the manual effort involved in the process and releases working capital for our customers. credit risk management brings customer and payment behavior data together to enable optimal risk strategies and real-time risk profiling. managing the balance between sales and risk of non-payment is critical to profitability. credit risk management brings together data from numerous sources, such as credit reference agencies, credit insurers, and payment performance to understand historical indebtedness and behavior trends of the companies with whom our customers work. this solution works in tandem with our collections management solution to help organizations better understand their customer base and make informed decisions around collection strategies, recovery sequences, and the prioritization of team tasks. collections management helps customers design collection strategies to fit each of their customer s sales ledger profile. releasing cash from customers is the fastest way to increase working capital. collections management streamlines the collections process and unlocks more cash from companies with automated escalating recovery sequences that enable collections teams to better prioritize their work by understanding which customers require attention. customers gain real-time clarity into what actions and collection strategies are working at each stage of the collection process and can use this information to collect payments more efficiently, leading to reduced days sales outstanding and improved customer relationships. disputes deductions helps our customers track payment disputes to drive prompt response and resolution. unresolved disputes lead to uncollected revenue and can threaten profitability. disputes deductions logs, monitors, and analyzes invoice disputes and provides our customers automated workflows to accelerate dispute resolution and protect their customer relationships. team task management automates accounts receivable teams tasks while ensuring timely execution by using data to drive priority of actions. the historically manual work behind accounts receivable processes can lead to siloed work and a lack of end-to-end visibility. team task management provides full visibility into the accounts receivable process, monitors critical actions against the volume of work, and allocates resources based on team capacity to prioritize risk management and cash collection. ar intelligence automatically processes, analyzes, and surfaces critical information such as sales and payment performance data, customer payment trends, and days sales outstanding. this solution unifies the data across blackline s ar solutions suite to provide data typically difficult to obtain in real time. customers using this solution gain insights into customer behavior, as well as the ability to measure the impact of extended payment terms to cash collections and cash flow, and understand the predictability of customer payments when building cash flow forecasts. intercompany accounting intercompany transactions occur when entities within a corporate parent organization transact with each other. these transactions are some of the most complex and frequent sources of uncertainty and process inefficiency for the accounting function. it is a manual, time-consuming, and resource-intensive process that can have material impacts on costs if not managed properly. our intercompany solutions manage the entire intercompany transaction lifecycle within our platform, from the initial creation of a transaction through the settlement. we believe it is the only widely available automated end-to-end intercompany solution maintained in a single platform. this solution includes the following features: intercompany create functionality replaces informal, ad hoc intercompany requests and approvals with a simple process that uses billing routes to facilitate the flow of a transaction and the appropriate tax and transfer pricing mark-ups. the application stores permissions and business logic exceptions by entity, service, and transaction type, ensuring that both the seller and the buyer of the intercompany transaction are authorized to conduct business, while billing in a manner that optimizes process efficiency and minimizes tax leakage. intercompany processing records an organization s intercompany transactions once they reach an appropriate completion level and posts them to the appropriate systems from a single source. the product automatically incorporates local taxes, exchange rates, invoicing requirements, and customer-specific transfer pricing for the nature of the services being billed, so that the resulting journal entries will net, which reduces the possibility of intercompany differences and eliminates the need to perform a manual reconciliation, while providing accurate reporting to business partners and auditors. netting and settlement automatically generates a real-time, aggregated settlement matrix, which shows the balance of transactions across an entire organization and uses bilateral netting to reduce the number of transactions that typically incur bank fees. users can filter the information by transaction type, hold type, currency or business relationship. this feature facilitates the process of netting transactions and helps users make informed, strategic decisions, while managing cash reporting and forecasting. services customer service is essential to our success. we offer the following services for our customers: implementation - with a focus on configuration over customization, our implementation approach favors rapid and efficient deployments led by accounting experts, rather than technical resources. a typical project will focus on mapping our application to a customer s current or ideal process, coaching them on best practices, and helping organizations become self-sufficient, instead of dependent on additional professional services. for clients that elect to work with a business process outsourcer or other company for implementation services, our implementation team provides ongoing support in order to ensure that the implementation or finance transformation projects are completed successfully. support - we provide live customer support / / from our offices in california, sydney and london. all customers have access to support resources by phone, email or through our portal, free of charge. customer success - our customer success managers, many of whom are former users, provide customers with best practices and help create a roadmap for expanded usage of our solutions. we believe that this service, which is made available to all customers, is central to our retention and upsell efforts. training - we offer a variety of live and web-based training options, but most customers elect to consume their training through our e-learning environment, blackline u. courses cover solutions functionality, as well as the underlying concepts that make reconciliation, the financial close and other accounting and finance activities necessary. sales and marketing we sell our solutions through our direct sales force. our direct sales force leverages our relationships with technology vendors such as sap and microsoft dynamics, professional services firms such as deloitte and ernst young and business process outsourcers such as cognizant, genpact and ibm, to influence and drive customer growth. since , we have partnered with sap, incorporating them into the reseller channel that we use in the ordinary course of business. sap has the ability to resell our solutions, as an sap solution-extension solex ), for which we receive a percentage of the revenues. solex allows us to provide the highest level integration with sap erp solutions. our marketing efforts are focused on creating sales leads, establishing and extending our brand proposition, generating product awareness, and cultivating our community of users. we generate sales leads primarily through word-of-mouth, search engine marketing, outbound lead generation, and our network of business process outsourcers, business services organizations and resellers. we leverage online and offline marketing channels on a global basis and organize customer roundtables and user conferences and release white papers, case studies, blogs, and digital programs and seminars to promote our innovative and comprehensive offerings. we have further extended our brand awareness through sponsorships with leading industry organizations such as the american institute of certified public accountants, or aicpa, the institute of management accountants, or ima, the financial executives international, or fei, the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales, or icaew, and the association of chartered certified accountants, or acca. competition the market for accounting and financial software and services is competitive, rapidly evolving and requires a deep understanding of the industry standards, accounting rules and global financial regulations. we compete with vendors of financial automation software and with certain erp software. further, other established software vendors not currently focused on accounting and finance software and services, including some of our partners, resellers, and other parties with which we have relationships, may expand their services to compete with us. we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following: level of customer satisfaction; ease of deployment and use of applications; ability to integrate with multiple legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications; domain expertise on accounting best practices; ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly; capability for configurability, integration and scalability of applications; cloud-based delivery model; advanced security and reliability features; brand recognition and historical operating performance; and price and total cost of ownership. we believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. however, certain of our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer and marketing relationships, larger marketing budgets, and significantly greater resources. intellectual property and proprietary rights our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. we currently have two patents. we primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our intellectual property rights. though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace. despite our efforts to preserve and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain portions of our software. competitors may attempt to develop similar products that could compete in the same market as our products. unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information by our employees or third parties could occur. laws of other jurisdictions may not protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure in the same manner as the united states. the risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as our company continues to expand outside of the united states. third-party infringement claims are also possible in our industry, especially as software functionality and features expand, evolve and overlap with other industry segments. human capital blackline\\'s approximately , employees worldwide

and has continued to take a proactive and supportive approach to helping our employees remain healthy and productive through the covid- pandemic, including supporting our employees ability to work from home and implementing covid- safety protocols to protect employee health and safety. we have continued to offer employee well-being initiatives, including physical and mental health programs, a global employee assistance program, and work-from-home reimbursements. compensation and benefits blackline strives to maintain a pay for performance compensation program that is competitive and appropriately balanced to attract, motivate, reward, and retain our talent. we benchmark and set compensation based on our compensation philosophy, and market data, as well as each employee s role, experience, location, and performance. we also review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay practices are fair and equitable. in addition to competitive compensation, we offer our employees a wide range of benefits such as comprehensive healthcare and wellness, competitive retirement benefits, time off, and recognition opportunities. employee engagement blackline regularly seeks input from employees through various methods, including through broad employee engagement and pulse surveys, which assess our degree of success in promoting an environment where employees are engaged, satisfied, productive, and possess a strong understanding of our business goals. in , we conducted our annual engagement survey with of global employees participating. blackline s engagement score is in line with industry benchmarks and our top scores were related to the company\\'s future, manager satisfaction, and diversity initiatives. we recognize the correlation between employee engagement and productivity and retention, and our leaders at all levels continue to implement changes recommended by our employees to reinforce and promote employee engagement. training and development we continually invest in our employees career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, self-directed learning, and support for continuing education through professional development and reimbursement programs. in , we advanced our career path framework and introduced a global individual development program. blackline employees are also offered training related to blackline products, and technical, leadership, and communications training. corporate information we were incorporated in

together with all of the other information in this annual report on form -k, including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. additional risk and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs, our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. in that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. summary risk factors our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should consider before investing in our company, as fully described below. the principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our company risky include, among others: if we are unable to attract new customers and expand sales to existing customers, our growth could be slower than we expect and our business may be harmed. our business and growth depend substantially on customers renewing their subscription agreements with us, and any decline in our customer renewals could adversely affect our operating results. current and future economic uncertainty and other unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results. we have a history of losses and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability. we continue to experience rapid growth and organizational change and if we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan. our quarterly results may fluctuate, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. if we are not able to provide successful enhancements, new features or modifications to our software solutions, our business could be adversely affected. we derive substantially all of our revenues from a limited number of software solutions, and our growth is dependent on their success. if our relationships with technology vendors and business process outsourcers are not successful, our business and growth may be harmed. if our security controls are breached or if unauthorized, or inadvertent access to customer, employee or other confidential data is otherwise obtained, our software solutions may be perceived as insecure, we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers, our business may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities. interruptions or performance problems associated with our software solutions, platform and technology may adversely affect our business and operating results. if our software contains serious errors or defects, we may lose revenue and market acceptance and may incur costs to defend or settle product liability claims. the covid- pandemic is having a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of certain of our customers and industries that we serve, which could harm our business and operating results. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results could be harmed. the market price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. risks related to our business and industry if we are unable to attract new customers and expand sales to existing customers, our growth could be slower than we expect and our business may be harmed. our growth depends in part upon increasing our customer base. our ability to achieve significant growth in revenues will depend, in large part, upon the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, both domestically and internationally. we may have difficulty attracting potential customers that rely on tools such as excel, or that have already invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate on-premise or other software into their businesses, as such organizations may be reluctant or unwilling to invest in a new product. if we fail to attract new customers or maintain and expand those customer relationships, our revenues will grow more slowly than expected and our business will be harmed. our growth also depends upon our ability to add users and sell additional products to our existing customers. it is important for the growth of our business that our existing customers make additional significant purchases of our products and add additional users to our platform. although our customers, users, and revenue have grown rapidly in the past, in recent periods our slower growth rates have reflected the size and scale of our business, as well as our focus on our strategic products. we cannot be assured that we will achieve similar growth rates in future periods as our customers, users, and revenue could decline or grow more slowly than we expect. our business also depends on retaining existing customers. if we do not retain customers, including due to the acquisition of our customers by other companies, or our customers do not purchase additional products or we do not add additional users to our platform, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected, may not grow at all or may decline. additionally, increasing incremental sales to our current customer base may require additional sales efforts that are targeted at senior management, which efforts are often associated with complex customer requirements and additional time to evaluate and test our products, and can lead to long and unpredictable sales cycles, particularly in the current macroeconomic environment. there can be no assurance that our efforts will result in increased sales to existing customers or additional revenues. our sales and marketing efforts may be impacted by geopolitical developments and other events beyond our control, such as the covid- pandemic, market price volatility, and macroeconomic trends. such events can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally, which has resulted in increased price sensitivity on the part of certain current and prospective customers, and could negatively impact sales for certain of our premium priced offerings. in addition, effects of the pandemic such as the ongoing supply chain disruption and labor shortages have adversely affected us, our customers, and our vendors. in response to covid- , we initially shifted our customer events to virtual-only experiences and we continue to adjust our practices and policies to respond to evolving restrictions and recommendations in the jurisdictions where we conduct business, including a partial return to in-person customer events. such adjustments in our practices and policies may not align with customer demand, and we may incur additional costs associated with in-person events or other practices, which may increase our expenses without a corresponding increase in revenue or other benefits. while covid- related restrictions have eased in many locations, evolving and uncertain conditions caused by the pandemic could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to attend our events, purchase new or additional products or services, or delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, or reduce the value or duration of their subscription agreements, all of which could adversely affect our growth. our business and growth depend substantially on customers renewing their subscription agreements with us and any decline in our customer renewals could adversely affect our operating results. our initial subscription period for the majority of our customers is one to three years. in order for us to continue to increase our revenue, it is important that our existing customers renew their subscription agreements when the contract term expires. although our agreements typically include automatic renewal language, our customers may cancel their agreements at the expiration of the term. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer users, renew for shorter contract lengths or renew for fewer products or solutions. renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our software or professional services, our pricing or pricing structure, the pricing or capabilities of products or services offered by our competitors, the effects of economic conditions, or reductions in our customers spending levels. for example, macroeconomic trends and the economic effects of covid- have impacted and may continue to impact our renewal rate. any prolonged shutdown of a significant portion of global economic activity or a downturn in the global economy would adversely affect the industries in which our customers operate, which could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to renew their subscription agreements or could cause our customers to downgrade the terms of their subscription agreements. further, as the markets for our existing solutions mature, or as current and future competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may experience pricing pressure and be unable to renew our agreements with existing customers or attract new customers at prices that are profitable to us. if this were to occur, it is possible that we would have to change our pricing model, offer price incentives or reduce our prices. if our customers do not renew their agreements with us or renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenues may decline. current and future economic uncertainty and other unfavorable conditions in our industry or the glob a l economy could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results. our operating results may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. general macroeconomic conditions, such as a recession or rising inflation rates or an economic downturn in the united states or internationally, could adversely affect demand for our products and make it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. we are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic downturn. to the extent unfavorable conditions in the national and global economy persist, or worsen, our business could be harmed as current and potential customers may reduce or postpone spending or choose not to purchase or renew subscriptions to our products, which they may consider discretionary. for example, as a result of uncertainty around general macroeconomic conditions, customers have begun to delay and defer purchasing decisions, which has resulted in the deterioration of near-term demand. in addition, certain of our customers have exhibited more price sensitivity, which may impact our sales, and in particular, sales of our premium priced products. the revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depend on demand for business software applications and services generally, and for accounting and finance systems in particular. services may decrease as new implementation projects are delayed. weakening economic conditions, and related corporate cost-cutting and tighter budgets, could affect the rate of accounting and finance and information technology spending and adversely affect our current or potential customers ability or willingness to purchase our cloud platform, as well as further delay purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which would adversely affect our operating results. prolonged economic uncertainties relating to macroeconomic trends or covid- could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results. unfavorable trends in the national or global economy, such as rising interest rates and conditions resulting from financial and credit market fluctuations may cause our customers and prospective customers to decrease their accounting and finance and information technology budgets, which would limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results. the occurrence of a natural disaster or global public health crisis such as the covid- pandemic or geopolitical uncertainty or war, could cause, and has caused customers to request concessions, including extended payment terms, free modules or better pricing. in addition, our customers may be affected by changes in trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs, as well as geopolitical volatility. trade protection measures, retaliatory actions, tariffs and increased barriers, policies favoring domestic industries, or increased import or export licensing requirements or restrictions, such as trade sanctions against russia in response to the war in ukraine, could have a negative effect on the overall macro economy and our customers, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. the aftermath of brexit also continues to cause significant political and economic uncertainty in both the uk and the european union (\"eu\"). as a result, the level of economic activity generally in this region could be adversely impacted, negatively affecting customer demand for our products and our operating results. uncertain economic conditions may also adversely affect third parties with which we have entered into relationships and upon which we depend in order to grow our business, such as technology vendors and public cloud providers. as a result, we may be unable to continue to grow in the event of prolonged economic uncertainty or future economic slowdowns. see risks related to our dependence on third parties. we continue to experience rapid growth and organizational change and if we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan. we continue to experience growth in our customer base and operations. our growth has placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources, particularly as we focus on cost discipline and efficiency. we anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure will be necessary to support the growth of our operations both domestically and internationally. these additional investments will increase our costs, with no assurance that our business or revenue will grow sufficiently to cover these additional costs. labor shortages and increased employee mobility may make it more difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees to support our growth. for example, labor shortages have created even greater competition for engineering talent, and we have had to expend additional resources to respond to attrition and to hire and retain new engineers. additionally, due to covid- , our workforce continues to be primarily remote, and we expect that our workplace will be fully or partially remote for the near term. we may experience difficulties onboarding new employees remotely, and maintaining a global organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce requires substantial management effort, the allocation of valuable management resources, and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. we may be unable to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures to effectively manage our operations and growth, which could negatively affect our results of operations and overall business. in addition, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which may negatively impact our gross margins or operating expenses and cause us to realign resources in order to improve operational efficiency, which may include a slowdown in hiring or reduction in force, such as the reduction in force announced in the fourth quarter of . moreover, if we fail to manage our anticipated growth or any realignment of resources, such as a restructuring or reduction in force, in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, employee morale, productivity and the quality of our software solutions may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers. if we are not able to provide successful enhancements, new features or modifications to our software solutions, our business could be adversely affected. if we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our existing solutions or new solutions that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be adversely affected. the success of enhancements, new products and solutions depends on several factors, including timely completion, introduction and market acceptance. we must continue to meet changing expectations and requirements of our customers and, because our platform is designed to operate on a variety of systems, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our solutions to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware and other software, communication, browser and database technologies. our platform is also designed to integrate with existing erp systems such as microsoft dynamics, oracle, and sap, and will require modifications and enhancements as these systems change over time. any failure of our solutions to operate effectively with future platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our solutions or result in customer dissatisfaction. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new solutions or technologies, or modifications to existing solutions or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. if we are not successful in developing modifications and enhancements to our solutions or if we fail to bring them to market in a timely fashion, our solutions may become less marketable, less competitive or obsolete, our revenue growth may be significantly impaired and our business could be adversely affected. we derive substantially all of our revenues from a limited number of software solutions, and our growth is dependent on their success. we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from our close process management solution, and expect to continue to derive a majority of our revenues from our close process management solution. as a result, the continued growth in market demand for this solution is critical to our continued success. we cannot be certain that any new software solutions or products we introduce will generate significant revenues. accordingly, our business and financial results have been and will be substantially dependent on a limited number of solutions. if our security controls are breached or unauthorized, or inadvertent access to customer, employee or other confidential data is otherwise obtained, our software solutions may be perceived as insecure, we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers, our business may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities. use of our platform involves the storage, transmission and processing of our customers proprietary data, including highly confidential financial information regarding their business and personal or identifying information of their customers or employees. additionally, we maintain our own proprietary, confidential and otherwise sensitive information. our platform is at risk for security breaches and incidents as a result of third-party action, employee, vendor or contractor error, malfeasance, ransomware and other malicious software, or other factors. the risk of a cybersecurity incident occurring has increased as more companies and individuals work remotely, potentially exposing us to new, complex threats. additionally, due to political uncertainty and military actions associated with the war in ukraine, we and our service providers are vulnerable to heightened risks of cybersecurity incidents and security and privacy breaches from or affiliated with nation-state actors. if any unauthorized or inadvertent access to, or a security breach or incident impacting our platform or other systems or networks used in our business occurs, such event could result in the loss, alteration, or unavailability of data, unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of data, and any such event, or the belief or perception that it has occurred, could result in a loss of business, severe reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, regulatory investigations and orders, litigation, indemnity obligations, and damages for contract breach or penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations. additionally, service providers who store or otherwise process data on our behalf, including third party and public-cloud infrastructure, also face security risks. as we rely more on third-party and public-cloud infrastructure, such as google cloud platform, and other third-party service providers, we will become more dependent on third-party security measures to protect against unauthorized access, cyberattacks and the mishandling of customer, employee and other confidential data and we may be required to expend significant time and resources to address any incidents related to the failure of those third-party security measures. our ability to monitor our third-party service providers\\' data security is limited, and in any event, attackers may be able to circumvent our third-party service providers\\' data security measures. there have been and may continue to be significant attacks on certain third-party providers, and we cannot guarantee that our or our third-party providers\\' systems and networks have not been breached or otherwise compromised, or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our platform. we may also suffer breaches of, or incidents impacting, our internal systems. security breaches or incidents impacting our platform or our internal systems could also result in significant costs incurred in order to remediate or otherwise respond to a breach or incident, which may include liability for stolen assets or information and repair of system damage that may have been caused, incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships after a breach, and other costs, expenses and liabilities. we may be required to or find it appropriate to expend substantial capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by any actual or perceived security breaches or incidents. additionally, many jurisdictions have enacted or may enact laws and regulations requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. these or other disclosures regarding a security breach or incident could result in negative publicity to us, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures which could impact our operating results. we incur significant expenses to minimize the risk of security breaches, including deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees annually, and engaging third-party experts and contractors. we continually increase our investments in cybersecurity to counter emerging risks and threats. if a high profile security breach or incident occurs with respect to another software as a service saas provider or other technology companies, our current and potential customers may lose trust in the security of our platform or in the saas business model generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones. such a breach or incident, or series of breaches or incidents, could also result in regulatory or contractual security requirements that could make compliance challenging. even in the absence of any security breach or incident, customer concerns about privacy, security, or data protection may deter them from using our platform for activities that involve personal or other sensitive information. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently, and often are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. we may also experience security breaches and incidents that may remain undetected for an extended period of time. periodically, we experience cyber security events including phishing attacks targeting our employees, web application and infrastructure attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a saas company of our size. these threats continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and are difficult to detect and predict due to advances in electronic warfare techniques, new discoveries in the field of cryptography and new and sophisticated methods used by criminals including phishing, social engineering or other illicit acts. we may experience security breaches and incidents introduced through the tools and services we use. for example, in the fourth quarter of , we became aware of reports that an update to widely-used it infrastructure management software provided by one of our vendors, solarwinds corporation, had been compromised by attackers. we have evaluated our internal systems and networks for vulnerable versions of the affected software, and we have detected no indicators of compromise. while we believe we were not negatively affected by this incident, we have invested time and resources to evaluate and protect our environment from potential supply chain risks, and we continue to monitor our infrastructure, adjust our intrusion detection capabilities, and practice security-by-design principles in our software development lifecycle to help prevent third-party related incidents. however, there can be no assurance that our defensive measures will prevent cyber-attacks or other security breaches or incidents, and any such attacks, breaches or incidents could damage our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business. because data security is a critical competitive factor in our industry, we make numerous statements in our privacy policy and customer agreements, through our certifications to standards and in our marketing materials, providing assurances about the security of our platform including detailed descriptions of security measures we employ. should any of these statements be untrue, be perceived to be untrue, or become untrue, even through circumstances beyond our reasonable control, we may face claims of misrepresentation or deceptiveness by the u.s. federal trade commission, state and foreign regulators and private litigants. our errors and omissions insurance policies covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses may not be sufficient to compensate for all potential liability. although we maintain cyber liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. interruptions or performance problems associated with our software solutions, platform and technology may adversely affect our business and operating results. our continued growth depends in part on the ability of our current and potential customers to access our platform at any time. our platform is proprietary, and we rely on the expertise of members of our engineering, operations and software development teams for its continued performance. we have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions of new functionality, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, denial of service attacks or other security related incidents. in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. because of the seasonal nature of financial close activities, increasing complexity of our platform and expanding user population, it may become difficult to accurately predict and timely address performance and capacity needs during peak load times. if our platform is unavailable or if our users are unable to access it within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business will be harmed. in addition, our infrastructure does not currently include the real-time mirroring of data. therefore, in the event of any of the factors described above, or other failures of our infrastructure, customer data may be permanently lost. our customer agreements typically include performance guarantees and service level standards that obligate us to provide credits in the event of a significant disruption in our platform. to the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be adversely affected. if our software contains serious errors or defects, we may lose revenue and market acceptance and may incur costs to defend or settle product liability claims. complex software such as ours often contains errors or defects, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. despite internal and third-party testing and testing by our customers, our current and future software may contain serious defects, which could result in lost revenue or a delay in market acceptance. since our customers use our platform for critical business functions such as assisting in the financial close or account reconciliation process, errors, defects or other performance problems could result in damage to our customers. they could seek significant compensation from us for the losses they suffer. although our customer agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims, existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitations. even if not successful, a product liability claim brought against us would likely be time-consuming and costly and could seriously damage our reputation in the marketplace, making it harder for us to sell our products. we depend on our executive officers and other key employees and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain highly-skilled employees could adversely affect our business. our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees. we rely on our leadership team, many of whom are new, in the areas of research and development, operations, security, marketing, sales and general and administrative functions. changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives could disrupt our business, and could impact our ability to preserve our culture, which could negatively affect our ability to recruit and retain personnel. we do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. any such departure could be particularly disruptive in light of the recent leadership transition and to the extent we experience management turnover, competition for top management is high and it may take months to find a candidate that meets our requirements. accordingly, the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have an adverse effect on our business. in addition, to execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly-qualified personnel. competition for personnel is intense, especially for engineers experienced in designing and developing software applications, and experienced sales professionals. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and this difficulty may be heightened by labor shortages, higher employee turnover and slower hiring rates associated with the covid- pandemic and hybrid or remote work. in addition, we may need to increase our employee compensation levels in response to competition, rising inflation or labor shortages, which would increase our operating costs and reduce our profitability. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. if we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. likewise, if competitors hire our employees, we may divert time and resources to deter any breach by our former employees or their new employers of their respective legal obligations. given the competitive nature of our industry, we have both received and asserted such claims in the past. in addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. if the perceived value of our equity awards declines, due to volatile market conditions, stock price fluctuations or otherwise, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly-skilled employees. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and growth prospects could be adversely affected. if our industry does not continue to develop as we anticipate or if potential customers do not continue to adopt our platform, our sales will not grow as quickly as expected, or at all, and our business and operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. we operate in a rapidly evolving industry focused on modernizing financial and accounting operations. our solutions are relatively new and have been developed to respond to an increasingly global and complex business environment with more rigorous regulatory standards. if organizations do not increasingly allocate their budgets to financial automation software as we expect or if we do not succeed in convincing potential customers that our platform should be an integral part of their overall approach to their accounting processes, our sales may not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all. our business is substantially dependent on enterprises recognizing that accounting errors and inefficiencies are pervasive and are not effectively addressed by legacy solutions. covid- has adversely affected economies and financial markets globally, with many businesses cutting spending on information technology deemed nonessential. during the past twelve months, we have seen certain new and existing customers halt or decrease investment in infrastructure, which has negatively impacted our business, operating results, and financial condition. future deterioration in general economic conditions, including as a result of covid- or the war in ukraine, or a slow economic recovery, may also cause our customers to reduce their overall information technology spending, and such reductions may disproportionately affect software solutions like ours to the extent customers view our solutions as discretionary. if our revenue does not increase for any of these reasons, or any other reason, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. the market for accounting and financial software and services is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services they offer. we often compete with other vendors of financial automation software, and we also compete with large, well-established, enterprise application software vendors whose software contains components that compete with our platform. in the future, a competitor offering erp software could include a free service similar to ours as part of its standard offerings or may offer a free standalone version of a service similar to ours. further, other established software vendors not currently focused on accounting and finance software and services, including some of our partners, resellers, and other parties with which we have relationships, may expand their services to compete with us. our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer and marketing relationships, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do. they may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements. in addition, some of our competitors have partnered with, or have acquired, and may in the future partner with or acquire, other competitors to offer services, leveraging their collective competitive positions, which makes, or would make, it more difficult to compete with them. with the introduction of new technologies, the evolution of our platform and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses or the failure of our platform to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business. failure to effectively organize or expand our sales resources could harm our ability to increase our customer base. increasing our customer base and sales will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to effectively organize and expand our sales and marketing operations and activities. as we have grown and scaled our operations, we have aligned our sales team to help streamline the customer experience. we rely on our direct sales force, which includes an account management team, to obtain new customers and to maximize the lifetime value of our customer relationships through retention and upsell efforts. our success will depend, in part, on our ability to support new and existing customer growth and maintain customer satisfaction. due to covid- , our sales and marketing teams generally avoided in-person meetings and have been primarily engaging with customers online and through other communication channels, including virtual meetings. there is no guarantee that our sales and marketing teams will be as successful or effective using these other communication channels as they try to build relationships. if we cannot provide our teams with the tools and training to enable them to do their jobs efficiently and satisfy customer demands, we may not be able to achieve anticipated revenue growth as quickly as expected. moreover, some industries particularly impacted by covid- , such as travel, hospitality, retail, and oil and gas significantly cut or eliminated capital expenditures for a period of time, which has negatively impacted our ability to grow our customer base in certain industries. in addition, we plan to continue to expand our direct sales force both domestically and internationally. we believe that there is significant competition for experienced sales professionals with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require. our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in part, on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining a sufficient number of experienced sales professionals. new hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new sales segments and territories. our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business. our business will be harmed if our sales expansion efforts do not generate a significant increase in revenue. the covid- pandemic and related economic disruptions have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of certain of our customers and industries that we serve, which could harm our business and operating results. covid- has disrupted the operations of our customers and partners, and may continue to disrupt their operations for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of supply chain constraints and uncertainty in the financial markets, all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results, including sales and cash flows. for example, covid- has adversely affected economies and financial markets globally, which has led to volatile financial markets and reduced technology budgets for some of our customers, which has adversely affected our sales and sales cycles. to the extent the ongoing covid- pandemic leads to an extended economic downturn, any resulting decrease in technology spending or increase in price sensitivity could adversely affect demand for our offerings and harm our business and operating results. it is not possible at this time to estimate the full extent of the impact of covid- and related economic disruptions on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected. we believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation for accounting and finance software is critical to our relationships with our existing customers and to our ability to attract new customers. the successful promotion of our brand attributes will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop high-quality software, and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitive products and services. our brand promotion activities may not ultimately be successful or yield increased revenue. in addition, independent industry analysts provide reviews of our platform, as well as products and services offered by our competitors, and perception of our platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. if these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors products and services, our brand may be adversely affected. the promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive, as we expand into new markets and as more sales are generated. to the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the increased expenses we incur. if we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, our business may not grow, we may have reduced pricing power relative to competitors, and we could lose customers or fail to attract potential customers, all of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully, or achieve the expected benefits of these transactions and other strategic transactions. we regularly evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets. for example, most recently we completed the fourq acquisition. we also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our products and services, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distributions or discount pricing. negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult, and expensive, and our ability to complete these transactions may be subject to approvals that are beyond our control. consequently, these transactions, even if announced, may not be completed. in connection with a strategic transaction, we may: issue additional equity or convertible debt securities that would dilute our existing stockholders; use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business; incur large charges or substantial liabilities; incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay; or become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, and amortization, or deferred compensation charges. any future acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. in particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, their software is not easily adapted to work with our platform, or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership, management or otherwise. acquisitions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources, and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our existing business. moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities, which may lead to additional expenses, impairment charges or write-offs, restructuring charges, or other adverse impacts to our business, results of operations, or financial condition. incorrect or improper implementation or use of our solutions could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects. our platform is deployed in a wide variety of technology environments and into a broad range of complex workflows. our platform has been integrated into large-scale, enterprise-wide technology environments, and specialized use cases, and our success depends on our ability to implement our platform successfully in these environments. we often assist our customers in implementing our platform, but many customers attempt to implement even complex deployments themselves or use a third-party service firm. if we or our customers are unable to implement our platform successfully, or are unable to do so in a timely manner, customer perceptions of our platform and company may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose not to renew or expand the use of our platform. our customers and third-party resellers may need training in the proper use of our platform to maximize its potential. if our platform is not implemented or used correctly or as intended, including if customers input incorrect or incomplete financial data into our platform, inadequate performance may result. because our customers rely on our platform to manage their financial close and other financial tasks, the incorrect or improper implementation or use of our platform, our failure to train customers on how to use our platform efficiently and effectively, or our failure to provide adequate product support to our customers, may result in negative publicity or legal claims against us. also, as we continue to expand our customer base, any failure by us to properly provide these services will likely result in lost opportunities for additional subscriptions to our platform. any failure to offer high-quality product support may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. in deploying and using our solutions, our customers depend on our support services team to resolve complex technical and operational issues. we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for product support. we also may be unable to modify the nature, scope and delivery of our product support to compete with changes in product support services provided by our competitors. increased customer demand for product support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. our sales are highly dependent on our business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. any failure to maintain high-quality product support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality product support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our solutions to existing and prospective customers, our business, operating results, and financial condition. we provide service level commitments under our customer contracts, and if we fail to meet these contractual commitments, our revenues could be adversely affected. our customer agreements typically provide service level commitments. if we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our applications, we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with service credits, refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services, or we could face contract terminations. our revenues could be significantly affected if we suffer unscheduled downtime that exceeds the allowed downtimes under our agreements with our customers. any extended service outages could adversely affect our reputation, revenues and operating results. risks related to our financial performance or results we have a history of losses and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability. we have incurred net losses attributable to blackline, inc. in recent periods, including . million, . million, and . million for the years ended december , , , and , respectively. we had an accumulated deficit of . million at december , . we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability. we also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on: development of our cloud-based platform, including investments in research and development, product innovation to expand the features and functionality of our software solutions and improvements to the scalability and security of our platform; sales and marketing, including expansion of our direct sales force and our relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms, business process outsourcers and resellers; additional international expansion in an effort to increase our customer base and sales; and general administration, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to being a public company. these investments may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business or any growth in revenue and may not be sufficient to offset the expense and may harm our profitability. if we fail to continue to grow our revenue, we may not achieve or sustain profitability. our quarterly results may fluctuate, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. if our quarterly financial results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who may follow our stock, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. some of the important factors that may cause our revenue, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to attract new customers and retain and increase sales to existing customers; the number of new employees added; the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; long sales cycles and the timing of large contracts; changes in our or our competitors pricing policies; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; new products, features or functionalities introduced by us and our competitors; significant security breaches, technical difficulties or interruptions to our platform; the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional products or services, delay a prospective customer s purchasing decision or affect customer retention, including the economic effects of covid- , inflation, increased interest rates or the war in ukraine; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the impact of new accounting pronouncements; the impact and timing of taxes or changes in tax law; the timing and the amount of grants or vesting of equity awards to employees; seasonality of our business; and changes in customer buying patterns. many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our revenue, operating results, and cash flows to vary widely. as such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. we typically add fewer customers in the first quarter of the year than other quarters. we also experience a higher volume of sales at the end of each quarter and year, which is often the result of buying decisions by our customers. seasonality may be reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes may not be immediately apparent, in our revenue, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue over the term of our agreements. we may also increase expenses in a period in anticipation of future revenues. changes in the number of customers and users in different periods will cause fluctuations in our financial metrics and, to a lesser extent, revenues. those changes and fluctuations in our expenses will affect our results on a quarterly basis, and will make forecasting our operating results and financial metrics difficult. our financial results may fluctuate due to our long and increasingly variable sales cycle. our sales cycle generally varies in duration between four to nine months and, in some cases, even longer depending on the size of the potential customer, the size of the potential contract and the type of solution or product being purchased. the sales cycle for our global enterprise customers is generally longer than that of our mid-market customers. in addition, the length of the sales cycle tends to increase for larger contracts and for more complex, strategic products like intercompany financial management. as we continue to focus on increasing our average contract size and selling more strategic products, we expect our sales cycle to lengthen and become less predictable. this could cause variability in our operating results for any particular period. a number of other factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include: the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our software solutions; the need to educate potential customers on the differences between traditional, on-premise software and saas solutions; the relatively long duration of the commitment customers make in their agreements with us; the discretionary nature and timing of potential customers purchasing and budget cycles and decisions; the competitive nature of potential customers evaluation and purchasing processes; announcements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors; and lengthy purchasing approval processes of potential customers, including due to increased scrutiny of spending. we may incur higher costs and longer sales cycles as a result of large enterprises representing an increased portion of our revenue. in this market, the decision to subscribe to our solutions may require the approval of more technical and information security personnel and management levels within a potential customer s organization, and if so, these types of sales require us to invest more time educating these potential customers. in addition, larger organizations may demand more features and integration services and have increased purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us, which may contain restrictive terms favorable to the larger organization. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater research and development, sales, product support and professional services resources to individual customers, resulting in increased costs and reduced profitability, and would likely lengthen our typical sales cycle, which could strain our resources. in addition, more sales are closed in the last month of a quarter than other times. if we are unable to close sufficient transactions in a particular period, or if a significant amount of transactions are delayed until a subsequent period, our operating results for that period, and for any future periods in which revenue from such transactions would otherwise have been recognized, may be adversely affected. recently, as a result of uncertainty around general macroeconomic conditions, customers have been delaying and deferring purchasing decisions, which has led to a deterioration in near term demand. in addition, we may devote greater research and development, sales, product support, and professional services resources to potential customers that do not result in actual sales or revenue, resulting in increased costs and reduced profitability, and which could strain our resources. we recognize subscription revenue over the term of our customer contracts and, consequently, downturns or upturns in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern. we recognize subscription revenue from our platform ratably over the terms of our customers agreements, most of which have one-year terms but an increasing number of which have up to three-year terms. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue related to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter may have a small impact on our revenue results for that quarter. however, such a decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our platform, and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of expansion or retention, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. we may also be unable to reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales. in addition, a significant majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the life of the agreement with our customer. as a result, increased growth in the number of our customers could continue to result in our recognition of more costs than revenue in the earlier periods of the terms of our agreements. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. we face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could harm our results of operations. we conduct transactions, particularly intercompany transactions, in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, primarily the british pound and the euro. as we grow our international operations, we expect the amount of our revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies to increase in the future. accordingly, changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar could affect our revenue and operating results due to transactional and translational remeasurements that are reflected in our results of operations. as a result of such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. in addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. we do not currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in foreign currencies. however, in the future, we may use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments. if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. we review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. at december , , we had goodwill and intangible assets with a net book value of . million primarily related to acquisitions. an adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or intangible assets. any such charges may have a material negative impact on our operating results. our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations. as of december , , we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards nols of . million and . million, respectively. in general, under section of the internal revenue code of , as amended (the code a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its nols to offset future taxable income. our existing nols may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize nols could be further limited by section of the code. future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under section of the code. furthermore, our ability to utilize nols of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. there is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of nols, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing nols could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future taxable income. for these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our nols, whether or not we attain profitability. the legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of , as modified by the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act, includes changes to the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate and changes to the rules governing the deductibility of certain nols, which may impact our ability to utilize such nols. risks related to our dependence on third parties if our relationships with technology vendors and business process outsourcers are not successful, our business and growth will be harmed. we depend on, and anticipate that we will continue to depend on, various strategic relationships in order to sustain and grow our business. we have established strong relationships with technology vendors such as sap and microsoft dynamics to market our solutions to users of their erp solutions, and professional services firms such as deloitte and ernst young, and business process outsourcers such as cognizant, genpact and ibm to supplement delivery and implementation of our applications. we believe these relationships enable us to effectively market our solutions by offering a complementary suite of services. in particular, our solution integrates with sap s erp solutions. sap is part of the reseller channel that we use in the ordinary course of business. sap has the ability to resell our solutions as an sap solution-extension solex ), for which we receive a percentage of the revenues. if we are unsuccessful in maintaining our relationship with sap, if our reseller arrangement with sap is less successful than we anticipate, if our customers that use an sap erp solution do not renew their subscriptions directly with us and instead purchase our solution through the sap reseller channel or if we are unsuccessful in supporting or expanding our relationships with other companies, our business would be adversely affected. identifying, negotiating and documenting relationships with other companies require significant time and resources. our agreements with technology vendors are typically limited in duration, non-exclusive, cancellable upon notice and do not prohibit the counterparties from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. for example, our agreement with sap can be terminated by either party upon six months notice and there is no assurance that our relationship with sap will continue. if our solution is no longer resold by sap as a solution extension, our business could be adversely affected. our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our platform. if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships, or if the counterparties to our relationships offer competing solutions, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could suffer. even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in improved operating results. we rely on google cloud platform (gcp), microsoft azure (azure), amazon web services (aws) and third-party data centers (collectively, public cloud providers to deliver our cloud-based software solutions, and any disruption of our use of public cloud providers could negatively impact our operations and harm our business. we manage our software solutions and serve most of our customers using a cloud-based infrastructure that has historically been operated in a limited number of third-party data center facilities in north america and europe. we are developing plans to migrate some of our third-party data centers to gcp, increasing our reliance on this cloud provider. additionally, we rely on azure to serve rimilia customers, and we rely on aws to serve fourq customers. as we implement the transition to gcp, there could be occasional planned or unplanned downtime for our cloud-based software solutions and potential service delays, all of which will impact our customers ability to use our solutions. we may also need to divert resources away from other important business operations, which could harm our business and growth. additionally, if the costs to migrate to gcp are greater than we expect or take significantly more time than we anticipate, our business could be harmed. we do not control the operation of our public cloud providers. any changes in third-party service levels or any disruptions or delays from errors, defects, hacking incidents, security breaches, computer viruses, ddos attacks, bad acts or performance problems could harm our reputation, damage our customers businesses, and adversely affect our business and operating results. our public cloud providers are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, public health crises, such as covid- , terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. we may have limited remedies against third-party providers in the event of any service disruptions. if our third-party public cloud providers are compromised or unavailable or our customers are unable to access our solutions for any reason, our business would be materially and adversely affected. our customers have experienced minor disruptions and outages in accessing our solutions in the past, and may experience disruptions, outages, and other performance problems. although we expend considerable effort to ensure that our platform performance is capable of handling existing and increased traffic levels, the ability of our cloud-based solutions to effectively manage any increased capacity requirements depends on our public cloud providers. our public cloud providers may not be able to meet such performance requirements, especially to cover peak levels or spikes in traffic, and as a result, our customers may experience delays in accessing our solutions or encounter slower performance in our solutions, which could significantly harm the operations of our customers. interruptions in our services might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits to customers, subject us to potential liability, and cause customers to terminate their subscriptions or harm our renewal rates. if we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, our customers could experience service shortfalls. the provisioning of additional cloud hosting capacity requires lead time. as we continue to restructure our data management plans, and increase our cloud hosting capacity, we have and expect to in the future move or transfer our data and our customers data. despite precautions taken during such processes and procedures, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service, and we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer of data to other facilities which may lead to, among other things, customer dissatisfaction and non-renewals. our public cloud providers have no obligations to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. if any of our public cloud providers increases pricing terms, terminates or seeks to terminate our contractual relationship, establishes more favorable relationships with our competitors, or changes or interprets their terms of service or policies in a manner that is unfavorable with respect to us, we may be required to transfer to other providers. if we are required to transfer to other providers, we would incur significant costs and experience possible service interruption in connection with doing so. if we are unable to develop and maintain successful relationships with resellers, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. we believe that continued growth in our business is dependent upon identifying, developing, and maintaining strategic relationships with companies that resell our solutions. we plan to expand our growing network of resellers and to add new resellers, in particular to help grow our mid-market business globally. our agreements with our existing resellers are non-exclusive, meaning resellers may offer customers the products of several different companies, including products that compete with ours. they may also cease marketing our solutions with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. we expect that any additional resellers we identify and develop will be similarly non-exclusive and not bound by any requirement to continue to market our solutions. if we fail to identify additional resellers in a timely and cost-effective manner, or at all, or are unable to assist our current and future resellers in independently selling our solutions, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. if resellers do not effectively market and sell our solutions, or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our reputation and ability to grow our business may also be adversely affected. we depend and rely upon saas applications from third parties to operate our business and interruptions or performance problems with these technologies may adversely affect our business and operating results. we rely heavily upon saas applications from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including billing and order management, enterprise resource planning, and financial accounting services. if these services become unavailable due to extended outages, interruptions, or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage finances could be interrupted and our processes for managing sales of our solutions and supporting our customers could be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained, and implemented, all of which could adversely affect our business. we rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our software solutions. we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties, including third-party saas applications, in order to deliver our software solutions. this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delaying or preventing our ability to provide our software solutions until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available, identified, obtained and integrated. in addition, errors or defects in third-party hardware or software used in our software solutions could result in errors or a failure, which could damage our reputation, impede our ability to provide our platform or process information, and adversely affect our business. risks related to our legal and regulatory environment our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our solutions to customers located outside of the united states, and thus our business is susceptible to risks associated with international sales and operations. we currently maintain offices and/or have personnel in australia, canada, france, germany, india, japan, mexico, the netherlands, poland, romania, singapore, and the united kingdom, and we intend to build out our international operations. we have also executed several acquisitions and strategic transactions as part of our ongoing international expansion strategy. we derived approximately , , and of our revenues from sales outside the united states in the years ended december , , , and , respectively. any international expansion efforts that we may undertake, such as our japanese joint venture, our rimilia acquisition, or our fourq acquisition, may not be successful. in addition, conducting international operations in new markets subjects us to new risks that we have not generally faced in the united states. these risks include: localization of our solutions, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements; lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions, such as sanctions against russia in response to the war in ukraine; differing technology standards; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and differing employer/employee relationships; fluctuations in exchange rates that may increase the volatility of our foreign-based revenue; potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value-added tax (or other tax) systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; uncertain political and economic climates, including the significant volatility in the global financial markets and increasing inflation; the impact of natural disasters, climate change, war, including the war in ukraine, and public health pandemics, such as covid- , on employees, customers, partners, third-party contractors, travel and the global economy; and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. these factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs. operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. any negative impact from our international business efforts could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition as a whole. privacy and cybersecurity concerns and evolving domestic or foreign laws and regulations, including increased restrictions of cross-border data transfers, may limit or reduce the adoption of our services, result in significant costs and compliance challenges, and adversely affect our business. global legal and regulatory requirements related to collecting, storing, handling, transferring, and otherwise processing personal data are rapidly evolving in ways that require our business to adapt to support our compliance and our customers compliance. as the regulatory focus on privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity intensifies worldwide, and jurisdictions increasingly consider and adopt laws and regulations relating to these matters, the potential risks related to processing personal data by our business may grow. in addition, possible adverse interpretations of existing laws and regulations by governments in countries where we or our customers operate, as well as the potential implementation of new legislation, could impose significant obligations in areas affecting our business or prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions where we operate. any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, or cybersecurity may adversely affect our business. privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity have become significant issues in the u.s., europe, and in many other jurisdictions where we offer our products. following the eu s passage of the general data protection regulation gdpr ), which became effective in may , the global regulatory landscape relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity has grown increasingly complex and fragmented and is rapidly evolving. as a result, our business faces current and prospective risks related to increased regulatory compliance costs, reputational harm, negative effects on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new customers, and increased potential exposure to regulatory enforcement, litigation, and/or financial penalties for non-compliance. for example, in july , the court of justice of the european union cjeu invalidated the privacy shield framework, which enabled companies to legally transfer data from the european economic area eea to the u.s. this ruling from the cjeu and recent rulings from various eu member state data protection authorities have created complexity and uncertainty regarding processing and transfers of personal data from the eea to the u.s. and certain other countries outside the eea. moreover, on june , , the european commission adopted new standard contractual clauses sccs ), which impose additional obligations relating to personal data transfers out of the eea. the new sccs, and similar standard contractual clauses adopted in the uk, may increase the legal risks and liabilities associated with cross-border data transfers, and result in material increased compliance and operational costs. a u.s. executive order has been issued that is anticipated to lead to the development of a new eu-u.s. privacy framework under which personal data can legally be transferred to the u.s. from the eea. it remains uncertain whether, and when, such a framework will be formally established, and uncertainty may continue about the legal requirements for transferring customer personal data to and from the eea and other regions, an integral process of our business. other countries such as russia, china, and india have also passed or are considering passing laws imposing varying degrees of restrictive data residency requirements, which have created additional costs and complexity, and any new requirements may result in additional costs and complexity. in addition, the uk has established its own domestic regime with the uk gdpr and amendments to the data protection act. while the uk gdpr so far mirrors the obligations in the gdpr and imposes similar penalties, the uk government is considering amending its data protection legislation. if uk regulation of data protection diverges significantly from the eu, new obligations and data flow issues could emerge, creating costs and complexity. actual or alleged f ailure to comply with the gdpr or the uk gdpr can result in private lawsuits, reputational damage, loss of customers, and regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant fines, including, under the gdpr, fines of up to eur million (or gbp . million under the uk gdpr) or four percent ( of global revenue, whichever is greater. regulatory developments in the u.s. present additional risks. for example, the california consumer privacy act ccpa took effect on january , , and the california privacy rights act cpra ), which expands upon the ccpa, was passed in november and became effective on january , . the ccpa and cpra give california consumers, including employees, certain rights similar to those provided by the gdpr, and also provide for statutory damages or fines on a per violation basis that could be very large depending on the severity of the violation. numerous other states, including virginia, colorado, utah, and connecticut have also enacted or are in the process of enacting or considering comprehensive state-level data privacy and security laws, rules and regulations. furthermore, the u.s. congress is considering privacy legislation, and the u.s. federal trade commission continues to fine companies for unfair or deceptive data protection practices and may undertake its own privacy rule making exercise. globally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own frameworks governing privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity with which we, and/or our customers, must comply. these laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the u.s. regulatory developments in these countries may require us to modify our policies, procedures, and data processing measures in order to address requirements under these or other applicable privacy, data protection, or cybersecurity regimes, and we may face claims, litigation, investigations, or other proceedings regarding them, initiated by private parties and governmental authorities, and may incur related liabilities, expenses, costs, and operational losses. our compliance efforts are further complicated by the fact that laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity around the world are rapidly evolving, may be subject to uncertain or inconsistent interpretations and enforcement, and may conflict among various jurisdictions. in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy, and other industry groups have established or may establish various new, additional, or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. our customers may require us, or we may find it advisable, to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by them or third parties, such as the ssae , soc , and soc audit processes. if we are unable to maintain such certifications, comply with such standards, or meet such customer requests, it could reduce demand for our services and adversely affect our business. compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity may require changes in our services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or negative effects on our ability to attract and retain customers in certain industries and foreign countries , which could adversely affect our business. the costs of compliance with, and other obligations imposed by, these laws and regulations may require modification of our services, limit use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, lead to significant fines, penalties, or liabilities for actual or alleged noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity concerns, whether valid or not valid , may inhibit the market adoption, effectiveness, or use of our services, particularly in certain industries and foreign countries . we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. our solutions are subject to export controls, including the commerce department s export administration regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the treasury department s office of foreign assets control. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular export or sale may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. the u.s. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the export, re-export or transfer of specific products and services to u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments and persons. even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provided to u.s. sanctions targets, our solutions could be sold by resellers or could be used by persons in sanctioned regions despite such precautions. failure to comply with the u.s. export control, sanctions and import laws could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. we and our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges, fines, and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. in addition, if our resellers fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or authorizations, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. in addition, various countries could enact laws that could limit our ability to distribute our solutions or could limit our customers ability to implement or access our solutions in those countries. changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our solutions in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from accessing our solutions or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solutions to some countries, governments or persons altogether. any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our solutions, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our solutions to current or potential customers with international operations. any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. changes in laws and regulations related to the internet and cloud computing or changes to internet infrastructure may diminish the demand for our solutions, and could have a negative impact on our business. the success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication, and business applications. federal, state, or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium. regulators in some industries have also adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of saas and cloud computing solutions. for example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for the use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to utilizing such software. changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our solutions in order to comply with these changes. in addition, government agencies or private organizations have imposed and may impose additional taxes, fees, or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet. these laws or charges could limit the growth of internet-related commerce or communications generally, or result in reductions in the demand for internet-based solutions and services such as ours. in addition, the use of the internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease-of-use, accessibility, and quality of service. the performance of the internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been adversely affected by viruses, worms, and similar malicious programs and the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. if the use of the internet is adversely affected by these issues, demand for our solutions could decline. the adoption of any laws or regulations adversely affecting the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our products and increase our operating costs. the current legislative and regulatory landscape regarding the regulation of the internet and, in particular, internet neutrality, in the united states is subject to uncertainty. the federal communications commission had previously passed open internet rules in february , which generally provided for internet neutrality with respect to fixed and mobile broadband internet service. on december , , the federal communications commission voted to repeal open internet rules generally providing for internet neutrality with respect to fixed and mobile broadband internet service regulations and return to a light-touch regulatory framework known as the restoring internet freedom order. the fcc s new rules, which took effect on june , , repealed the neutrality obligations imposed by the rules and granted providers of broadband internet access services greater freedom to make changes to their services, including, potentially, changes that may discriminate against or otherwise harm our business. however, a number of parties have appealed this order. the d.c. circuit court of appeals recently upheld the fcc s repeal, but ordered the fcc to reconsider certain elements of the repeal; thus the future impact of the fcc\\'s repeal and any changes thereto remains uncertain. in addition, in september , california enacted the california internet consumer protection and net neutrality act of , making california the fourth state to enact a state-level net neutrality law since the fcc repealed its nationwide regulations. this act mandated that all broadband services in california be provided in accordance with california\\'s net neutrality requirements. the u.s. department of justice has sued to block the law going into effect, and california has agreed to delay enforcement until the resolution of the fcc\\'s repeal of the federal rules. a number of other states are considering legislation or execution action that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. in its recent decision on the fcc s repeal, the d.c. circuit court of appeals also ruled that the fcc does not have the authority to bar states from passing their own net neutrality rules. it is uncertain whether the fcc will argue that some state net neutrality laws are preempted by federal law and challenge such state net neutrality laws on a case-by-case basis. we cannot predict whether the fcc order or state initiatives will be modified, overturned or vacated by legal action. additional changes in the legislative and regulatory landscape regarding internet neutrality, or otherwise regarding the regulation of the internet, could also harm our business. our international operations subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences. we report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. the relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the value of assets sold or acquired or income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. if such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations. we believe that our financial statements reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency, but there can be no assurances in that regard. the enactment of legislation implementing changes in the u.s. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. u.s. tax laws that, among other things, include limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits, as well as changes to u.s. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could increase our effective tax rate. due to expansion of our international business activities, any changes in the u.s. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. in addition, the recently enacted inflation reduction act includes, among other provisions, an alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income and a excise tax on stock buybacks. these and other proposed or implemented changes in u.s. tax law could adversely impact our financial results. finally, current and future changes to non-u.s. tax laws, including the continuing development of the organization for economic cooperation and development base erosion and profit shifting recommendations, could negatively impact the anticipated tax benefits of our international structure or increase taxes imposed upon us. taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected, or in the future should collect, sales and use, value-added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations. sales and use, value-added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction and are subject to change from time to time. some jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations. risks related to our intellectual property any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. our success and ability to compete depend, in part, upon our intellectual property. we currently have two patents and primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. however, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. in order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. in the past, we have utilized demand letters as a means to assert and resolve claims regarding potential misuse of our proprietary or trade secret information. litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business. lawsuits or other claims by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant expenses or liabilities. there is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. our success depends, in part, on not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. from time to time, our competitors or other third parties may claim that our solutions and underlying technology infringe or violate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights. we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology. any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our solutions or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or other companies in connection with any such litigation and to obtain licenses, modify our solutions, or refund subscription fees, which could further exhaust our resources. in addition, we may incur substantial costs to resolve claims or litigation, whether or not successfully asserted against us, which could include payment of significant settlement, royalty or license fees, modification of our solutions, or refunds to customers of subscription fees. even if we were to prevail in the event of claims or litigation against us, any claim or litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and other employees from our business operations. such disputes could also disrupt our solutions, adversely impacting our customer satisfaction and ability to attract customers. we use open source software in our products, which could subject us to litigation or other actions. we use open source software in our products and may use more open source software in the future. from time to time, there have been claims challenging the use of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. as a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming misuse of, or a right to compensation for, what we believe to be open source software. litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. in addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software products. if we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our products, discontinue the sale of our products or take other remedial actions. risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. the market price of our common stock since our initial public offering has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; ratings changes by any securities analysts who follow our company; announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular; price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole; changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles; actual or perceived privacy, security, data protection, or cybersecurity incidents; actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors businesses or the competitive landscape generally; developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property, or our products or third-party proprietary rights; announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors; new laws or regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; any major change in our board of directors or management; sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders; issuances of shares of our common stock, including in connection with an acquisition or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding notes; lawsuits threatened or filed against us; and other events or factors, including those resulting from war, such as russia\\'s invasion of ukraine, incidents of terrorism, outbreaks of pandemic diseases, such as covid- , presidential elections, civil unrest, or responses to these events. in addition, the stock markets, and in particular the nasdaq market on which our common stock is listed, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and stock prices generally dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of and first half of . in the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. if we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from operating our business, and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. provisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of the company more difficult and may impede attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the delaware general corporation law (the dgcl contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. among other things: we have authorized but unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include supermajority voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of stockholders; we have a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms; stockholder action by written consent is prohibited; any amendment, alteration, rescission or repeal of our amended and restated bylaws or of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation by our stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of the voting power of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class outstanding; and stockholders are required to comply with advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. further, as a delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. these anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock. we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation, and expansion of our business, and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our stock price, which may never occur. our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the state of delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act, each of which could limit our stockholders ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for ( ) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, ( ) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, ( ) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, or ( ) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the court of chancery of the state of delaware (or, if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the district of delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants and provided that this exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act. section of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such securities act actions. accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. to prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of the united states of america will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act. however, while the delaware supreme court ruled in march that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the securities act be brought in federal court are \"facially valid\" under delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our federal forum provision. if the federal forum provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters. any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. this exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws may limit a stockholder\\'s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations. risks related to our outstanding convertible notes servicing our notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash to settle conversions of the notes in cash, to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change, or to repay the principal amount of the notes in cash at their maturity, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes. as of december , , we had . million aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding and . billion aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding. holders of either series of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of such notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change before the applicable maturity date at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of such notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest or special interest, if any, as described in the applicable indenture governing such notes. in addition, upon conversion of the notes of the applicable series, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of such notes being converted, as described in the applicable indenture governing such notes. moreover, we will be required to repay the notes of the applicable series in cash at their respective maturity unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. however, we may not have enough available cash on hand or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of such notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to such series of notes being converted or at their respective maturity. further, if either series of the notes convert and we elect to issue common stock in lieu of cash upon conversion, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution. in addition, our ability to repurchase the notes of the applicable series or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes or at their respective maturity may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or agreements governing our future indebtedness. our failure to repurchase such notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture governing such notes or to pay cash upon conversions of such notes or at their respective maturity as required by the applicable indenture governing such notes would constitute a default under such indenture. a default under such indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness. moreover, the occurrence of a fundamental change under the applicable indenture governing the notes could constitute an event of default under any such agreement. if the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness and repurchase such series of notes or pay cash with respect to such series of notes being converted or at maturity of such series of notes. our current and future indebtedness may limit our operating flexibility or otherwise affect our business. our existing and future indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders and significant effects on our business. for example, it could: make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, including the notes; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; restrict us from exploiting business opportunities; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general purposes. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. the conditional conversion feature of each series of the notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. in the event the conditional conversion feature of either series of notes is triggered, holders of the notes of such series will be entitled under the applicable indenture governing the notes to convert such notes at any time during the specified periods at their option. as of december , , the conditional conversion features of the notes were not triggered. if the conditional conversion feature of either series of notes is triggered and one or more holders of a series elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. in addition, in certain circumstances, such as conversions by holders or redemption, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or certain of the outstanding principal of such series of notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped calls. in connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into the capped calls with the counterparties with respect to each series of notes. the counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions at any time prior to the respective maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call). this activity could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. in addition, global economic conditions have in the past resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. the counterparties to the capped calls are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of the counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the capped calls. if a counterparty to one or more capped calls becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under such transaction. our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, it will increase if the market price or the volatility of our common stock increases. upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by a counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the counterparties. general risk factors we may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, such as refinancing needs, the need to develop new features or enhance our existing solutions, or to improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds, or we may opportunistically decide to raise capital. if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity or convertible debt securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. in addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms favorable to us, or at all. if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired. the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members. as a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of , as amended (the exchange act the sarbanes-oxley act of (the \"sarbanes-oxley act\"), the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of , the listing requirements of nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. the exchange act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. in order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. we are required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis and are required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. additionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section . as a result of the complexity involved in complying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. although we have hired additional employees to assist us in complying with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses. in addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time-consuming. these laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. we intend to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from business operations to compliance activities. if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business, financial conditions, and operating results may be adversely affected. if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us. if few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively affected. if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline. we may fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future and may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and the price of our common stock. as a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. section of the sarbanes-oxley act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. the process of designing and implementing internal control over financial reporting required to comply with section of the sarbanes-oxley act has been and will continue to be time consuming, costly and complicated. if, during the evaluation and testing process, we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that there are material weaknesses with respect to our internal controls or the level at which our internal controls are documented, designed, implemented, or reviewed. if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or when required in the future, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to stockholder lawsuits, litigation or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the sec, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources, and cause investor perceptions to be adversely affected and potentially resulting in restatement of our financial statements for prior periods and a decline in the market price of our stock. natural disasters, climate change, and other events beyond our control could harm our business. natural disasters, climate change, or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce, and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, climate-related events, pandemics, such as covid- , terrorism, political unrest, geopolitical instability, war, such as the war in ukraine, and other events beyond our control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our solutions to our customers, could decrease demand for our solutions, and could cause us to incur substantial expense. the majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations are located in california, which has experienced, and is projected to continue to experience, major earthquakes, droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our business could be harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other catastrophic event. our insurance may not be sufficient to cover related losses or additional expenses that we may sustain. in addition, we may be subject to increased regulations, reporting requirements, standards, or expectations regarding the environmental impacts of our business, and failure to comply with such regulations, requirements, standards or expectations could adversely affect our reputation, business or financial performance. item b'"
